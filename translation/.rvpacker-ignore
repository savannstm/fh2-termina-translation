GabText \N[1]...
Unfortunately the only class available in this demo\#version is Mercenary.
GabText First, you must choose your profession
Caution! This game contains scenes of extreme\#violence  and gore. The game also covers themes of\#sexual violence, drug usage and child abuse.
Knight - Righteous and discliplined. Following the path\#of the sword is as much about physical, as it is about\#mental strength. Excels in melee combat.
Dark Priest - Alchemy and ritual passages have gained\#you deeper knowledge of human nature. There is no right\#and wrong, only the way of the gods.
GabText Your journey has lead you to this wretched place.
Mercenary - A warrior class that will do whatever it\#takes to see the light of the next day. There isn't\#a task you wouldn't undertake for a bag of silver coins.

You learn \c[2]Dash\c[0].
This really is your make-or-break mission. There is a person\#back in the city relying on you to return with riches. You\#have heard rumours about this place and you are sure that\#there are great treasures hidden somewhere in these ruins...
Pray for Gro-goroth
You learned \c[2]Fast stance\c[0].
Devour your fallen comrades
Take souveniers from Vinland
You get a \c[2]Long sword\c[0] and an \c[2]Eagle crest shield\c[0].
Strike your dagger to her spine while she walks away
It was this small overblow that was enough of an excuse\#for the Kingdom of Rondon to turn common folks against\#Le'garde and justify his imprisonment.
Le'garde saw potential in you and with warm words, he\#almost seduced you to join his band of mercenaries. Thanks\#to your rigorous discipline, you took a high position in\#his army, the Knight of the Midnight Sun.
As time went on, you proved out to be a gifted fighter and\#a valuable asset to the army of Rondon. However...
You were born with the soul of the enlightened. You are\#always seeking restlessly for new knowledge and secrets\#hidden from common folk.
After leaving the temple grounds, you vowed to become a\#dark priest by your own merits and prove your fate wrong.
Unfortunately the relics you brought from the trip tainted\#you and you formed a Panophobia, a fear of everything.
You get \c[2]30 Silver coins\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Devour\c[0].
He was the famous captain from the fabled mercenary army\#Knights of the Midnight Sun. You immediately packed and\#left after him. The man would witness the iron will tempered\#in the north and in the dark continent of Vinland.
As if the trip wasn't dark enough, when you finally found\#land, it was something no one in the civilized world could\#ever imagine. From the far reaches of the world you found the\#dark continent of Vinland.
Stock up on healing items
You get a \c[2]7 Tinderboxes\c[0], a \c[2]Quill\c[0]\#and a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0].
You knew you didn't have much time before he would be\#sentenced to death, so you had to act fast.
Just as things seemed too dark, you saw a light in the\#darkness. You met a captain of a small mercenary army who\#seemed to share the same ill-will towards the Kingdom of\#Rondon as you.
You were finally granted a pass to the great libraries\#of the Kingdom of Rondon. You now had the collection of\#all known history and science at your grasp.
Stock up on equipment
You get a \c[2]Pipe\c[0] and \c[2]Opium powder\c[0].
Rush straight for your mission
You swallowed your grief and doubt and decided to stay as\#a holy knight. In the end you could try to fix things up\#from the inside, you figured.
Le'garde was taken as a captive and to be used most likely\#on propaganda.
You get a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0].
Before leaving for your desperate journey, you decided\#to stock up on equipment and items...
Many of your comrades were slain, but you managed to escape\#the battlefield.
You spent your last night in the kingdom...
You were born with the soul of the endless that makes you\#yearn for freedom and forces you to push your creativity to\#its limits.
You get a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0] and 2 \c[2]Cloth fragments\c[0].
As the weak met their fate, the rest indulged in the greatest\#sin...
Don't touch anything and flee back to your ship
Stock up on magical items
Choose bow & arrows
You get also get a \c[2]Plate mail\c[0] and \c[2]Leg guards\c[0].
At this point family ties weighted no more than strangers\#you met at the dirty streets of Rondon. You completely cut\#ties with your family wihout hesitation.
You learn \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
Winters grew colder and summers shorter, which resulted\#a great hunger in the north. The fine men of the Oldegård\#set sails to the unknown west in a desperate attempt to\#find food and riches to feed the people.
You learn \c[2]Escape plan\c[0].
Quietly leave and run away without revenge
Your devotion was shaken. You were all but ready to retire\#from the army, but your family insisted - no, they demanded\#you to stay as a holy knight, or else you'd bring great\#shame to their noble family.
Stock up healing items for the mission
Just as you were about to flee from the army, things took\#an unexpected turn for you. You met a captain of a small\#mercenary army who seemed to share the same ill-will towards\#the Kingdom of Rondon as you.
Vengeful in how you had been treated, you set the temple on\#fire, jammed the exit door so no one could escape and then\#ran away. Only muffled screams could be heard coming from\#the temple.
You learned of a certain man who was propheticed to begin\#a new era for mankind. A man meant for greatness. But why\#would you need to share the spotlight of the gods with any\#mortal man?
Quickly stepped aside and dodged it
You put your creativity to test in the most harshest of\#enviroments. You were born and soon abandoned in the capital\#of the Eastern Sanctuaries - Jettaiah.
Spearhead the coming assault.
You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0].
You learned that the man has since been imprisoned in the\#Kingdom of Rondons dungeons. In the notorious dungeons\#of Fear & Hunger.
It is said that a fighter shows their true colours in their\#first fight. This applied to you too. When you saw the\#sword coming your way, you...
During one of your many raids, your brigade got ambushed.\#The odds were seriously against you. You could have just\#abandoned your comrades and kept you life, or you could have\#fought to your last breath.
You get \c[2]4 Blue herbs\c[0], a \c[2]White vial\c[0] and\#\c[2]2 Cloth fragments\c[0].
It was almost too much for you, when Le'garde decided to\#raid the northen capital Oldegård and slayed everyone who\#stood in the way between him and this mysterious ancient\#relic. You never understood it's importance.
With the aid of your new slaves, you eventually grew strong\#enough to climb up the well. You creeped upstairs to the\#temple and noticed it was night time.
You were born with the soul of the tormented. You are\#destined to struggle in every step you take in life, but\#this just ultimately makes you stronger physically and tempers\#your iron will that rivals the will of the gods themselves.
Pray for God of the Depths
Your army was growing fast in both size and influence in the\#western regions. The Kingdom of Rondon would first use your\#services to their own benefit, but soon saw you more as a\#possible threat to their modern reigns.
You learn \c[2]Lockpicking\c[0].
You travelled across the land in your raids and eventually\#settled down in the Kingdom of Rondon where silver was\#loose as long as you were up for getting your knife dirty.
Something changed with Le'garde as well. He kept more to\#himself and studied ancient texts and occult. He became\#obsessed with some relics and artefacts that gave you omnious\#feelings and terrible nightmares.
You quietly left the temple area thinking that revenge\#doesn't solve anything, but in order to make sure you\#survive on your own you took some precious books to secure\#your wealth.
You learn \c[2]Steal\c[0].
Fight to the last breath
You get an \c[2]Iron spear\c[0].
You set your mind - You will kill everything that carries\#a dark soul in the dungeons, you will have your revenge\#and the dark artefact will be yours again. There is no\#other way.
You get a \c[2]Wine vial\c[0], a \c[2]Bottle of whiskey\c[0]\#and an \c[2]Ale\c[0].
You had to choose at a very young age to either become a\#pickpocket, a burglar or try to struggle and lead a honest\#life.
Take the rear and manage defences.
You get an \c[2]Iron mace\c[0] and a \c[2]Wooden buckler\c[0].
Your life spent learning thievery certainly didn't go to\#waste. You learned to live with constant fear and danger\#over the years. The crude streets of Jettaiah teached you\#valuable lessons.
You get a \c[2]Dried meat\c[0], a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0] and\#3 \c[2]Carrots\c[0].
Eventually you lost your mind to the hunger and like a\#raging wolf you cried the night on the deck, while others\#feasted on the fallen.
You travelled across the western continent, learning of\#different gods, deities, blood magic and all known sciences.\#Your studies didn't come without their merits. You were\#acknowledged by the top scholars of the modern times.
As the troops of the Rondon army marched towards your\#clearly smaller army, you had to choose which position\#to take in the coming encounter.
Prophecies are only for those who are weak enough to bend\#to their sorry fates. You need to find this man and learn\#more. To your current knowledge, he would be found\#imprisoned at the notorious dungeons of Fear & Hunger.
Stock up on intoxicants
You get 3 \c[2]Iron arrows\c[0] and a \c[2]Bear trap\c[0].
She however showed mercy and withdrew her dagger. She\#took steps away from you as your high priest masters glared\#gleefully at the event unfolding before their very eyes.
Listen to your family and stay as a holy knight.
You also get an itch in your groin area...
Don't give in
Even if it seemed like a suicide mission, you decided to\#save Le'garde from the prisons he was held in.
Your family gave you a gift of \c[2]20 Silver coins\c[0].
You stroke your dagger to the spine of your sister and she\#collapsed on the ground. You high priest masters seemed\#especially pleased with this and prepared you for your\#ascension ceremony.
The dark priests got no place for the weak, so you were\#thrown in an underground well. There you were meant to\#quietly wither away, but instead you fed on insects and other\#small critters that shared your fate down there.
Break ties with your family and run away.
This is it. Your stairway to enlightenment. You are set\#to discover the ancient secrets this stronghold keeps and\#to reach the ultimate understanding of the greater scheme\#of things.
You get \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1\c[0].
The Knights of the Midnight Sun lost the fight.
An ancient artefact was brought from the dark continent.\#You knew it was a mistake, but the choice wasn't in your\#hands. While you were hunting, away from home, a mercenary\#army raided your village.
One day you got an omnious task from the officials of the\#Kingdom of Rondon. You are to be paid well in silver to get\#a captain of a fabled mercenary army out of the dungeons\#of Rondon itself.
You get 3 \c[2]Dried meat\c[0], a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0] and\#a \c[2]Cheese\c[0].
Choose mace and shield
You had grown into your manhood and aboarded the ship.\#After months of sailing, the sea saw no end and the crew\#was struggling for their life. Some laid weak under the\#deck while some embraced the cold dark sea.
Stock up food for the mission
Go drinking and get laid at the brothel
You learned \c[2]Defence stance\c[0].
Like typical to such occult rites, you were pitted against\#your sibling with ritual daggers and challenged to fight\#each other to the death.
From the dungeons of Fear and Hunger. The morbid place has\#been used as a wartime prison by the kingdom and for some\#reason they need an outside sword like yourself to infiltrate\#their very own stronghold.
Pray for Sylvian
The Kingdom of Rondon claimed to follow the will of the\#gods in it's pursuit for more power. But all the rewards\#seemed to fall into the laps of the elite and noble sitting\#comformtably behind the castle walls.
You were born with the soul of domination that makes\#people around you bend to your will. You are a natural\#leader, but you might often end up blind to self-criticism.
You decided to stock up before your travels.
The common folk was starting to gather around the\#charismatic leader Le'garde, who shared the humble origin\#similar to farmers and villagers alike. There was\#definitely something otherworldy in his stature.
Raised your buckler in defence
Rush straight after him
Pray for Alll-Mer
Abandon your comrades
The dungeons open before you... You won't leave the ruins\#without Le'garde. One way or another, you two will be\#reunited. Even if it requires you to give up on your\#principles.
You get also get a \c[2]Iron cuirass\c[0] and \c[2]Arm guards\c[0].
Not many survived the ambush, but that just meant that the\#mission rewards got less takers. You were one of the lucky\#ones.
In the ascension ceremony you were to resurrect your\#deceased sister with necromancy and use her as your ghoul.\#You did this and the cold corpse of your sister brought\#a smile to your otherwise emotionless face.
Unfortunate for you, you were born with a fragile body\#and your sister easily overpowered you and had her dagger\#on your neck waiting for the final blow.
Training to become a squire was a harsh school that spared\#no one. No matter if you were from a noble origin or not.
This trait already started showing itself at a very young\#age as you were chosen to become a dark priest upon the birth\#of you and your twin sister.
You struggled through your early life, but managed to get\#by as a merchant of sorts. Your skills of haggling and\#speech improved over the years and you also managed to\#gather some savings.
With time you learned to understand the language they\#spoke. You learned \c[2]Mastery over insects\c[0].
So even if the mission was to go south for some reason,\#you are not going to return empty handed.
However your endless soul yearned for more...\#You couldn't just become a family man, grow fat and make\#a living as a mere merchant. You were destined for more.
Your life spend learning thievery certainly didn't go to\#waste. You learned to live with constant fear and danger\#over the years. The crude streets of Jettaiah teached you\#valuable lessons.
Ruthlessly the kingdom would expand it's reign.\#Reducing the feeble citadels to ashes and blood stains.\#Enslaving the sweet women folk whilst every man is slain.\#Only spare a child or two, that it's legend may grow.
Set the temple on fire and leave
As you grew older you took part in various mercenary armies\#and learned the dirtiest tricks to stay alive. You were taken\#in by a notorious veteran highwayman and you joined his little\#band of criminals and ex-soldiers.
When beginning your self-studies, you first had to choose\#the god you'd dedicate your time to.
Upon your return, you witnessed your home burning, your\#family slain and the artefact stolen. Those who survived\#the raid described the army and it's captain.
If your birth sign wasn't enough to warrant a future of\#greatness, you were also born into a wealthy noble family.\#At an early age you were sent into training to become\#a holy knight of Kingdom of Rondon.
The continent had never been touched by a civilized man.\#The land was tainted by ancient deities and gods you had\#never even heard of. The things you witnessed there left a\#mark in you that could never be washed away.
Something is clearly not right about this mission and you\#have felt nauseus since the the moment you agreed on the\#job. But you are short on silver and the reward is all that\#matters in the end.
You had a balanced childhood in the city of Oldegård with\#both of your parents always present. Your father taught you\#in the art of war. The very first step was to choose your\#weapon.
After your ascension to dark priesthood, you were to leave\#the temple grounds and learn of occult on your own in your\#dark pilgrimage.
You get a \c[2]Short bow\c[0] and 5 \c[2]arrows\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Bloodlust\c[0].
Accept your defeat
A practice sparring match between you and a well seasoned\#squire took place at the central training grounds.
Lead a honest life
Some of your comrades lost their minds while others tried to\#pillage anything worthwhile before leaving the macabre place.

The book is summoning powers that exceed your\#understanding.
Next to this ancient presence, you're nothing\#but a feeble ant.
You feel a twist inside as you take the book from\#your satchel...
Leave the book
You lose your mind.
Read the book
You cannot contain your fear.
It turns out that this book is the very book\#many legends tell about...
You feel great urge to open the book - but at the same\#time you feel like consequences might be terrible.

You remember... How riches and wealth dictated\#your masters. All while still holding a grasp at freedom\#by travelling across the known continents.
You remember your ancestors living in the frozen wastelands\#of Oldegärd.
You remember how the voice would teach you skills to help\#you one day extract revenge from the wrong-doings of your\#uprising.
You have already aqcuired everything from your family line.
You remember... How the cruelty knew no end. Every day you\#would be pitted against beasts from exotic locations.
You remember \c[2]Fast attack\c[0]!
You remember... The wolf deity teaching you his\#greatest secret...
You remember... The feast you would have the next day.\#There was so much meat on the open fire that it could feed\#the animals of the surrounding forests as well.
As you open the book, you feel warmth and nostalgia\#that cannot be explained.
You remember your ancestors from a long line of noble\#knights from the Kingdom of Rondon.
You remember... How the priests, your caretakers, would use\#punishing and cruel ways to imbed the moral codes and ways\#of the knighthood.
You remember... How neither of you had ate a thing in past\#two weeks. How the hunger would drive even the most good-\#hearted man insane.
You remember... After generations of these black arts, your\#ancestors finally managed to summon a wretched little evil.
You remember \c[2]Greater blood magic\c[0]!
And every night you would be pitted against the beast of\#the monastery as the monks would crawl next to you in the\#darkest hours of the night.
You remember... How from every generation - only the eldest\#child would be chosen to continue the family name...
You remember... How for a price of your beloved ones\#you could attain greater knowledge. You agreed of\#course - being the greedy bastard you were.
You remember \c[2]Counter\c[0]!
You remember... How your ancestors would desperately try\#to contact even the most minor demons in their attempts to\#gain more knowledge of the otherside.
You remember... Slowly sinking to the darkness within and\#hearing a voice...
You remember... How from a very early age, every single\#of your ancestors had to partake the training to become\#a holy knight of Alll-Mer.
You remember your ancestors leading a simple yet\#violent life of mercenaries.
You remember... Freezing winters, where the weather and gods\#would measure the resiliency of your people. Only the\#strongest would see the sun rising again in the spring.
You remember \c[2]Steal\c[0]!
You remember \c[2]Marksmanship\c[0]!
You remember \c[2]Dash\c[0]!
You remember \c[2]Bloodlust\c[0]!
You remember... His feeble arms trying to wrestle you down.\#But he proved to be the weaker of the two of you.
You remember how in exchange for a plate of your father,\#the animals would teach you their own tricks of trade for\#survival.
...While the rest would be cut open and have their blood\#drained as a sacrifice to older gods.
You remember \c[2]Blood sacrifice\c[0]!
The miscreant that crawled from the summoning circle\#revealed it's secrets.
Memories of your past life flash before your eyes.\#But some of these memories are not of yours.
You remember... While murdering cold blood\#your victims on a highway heist - you had a greeting\#with the wolf deity of northern parts.
You remember... How your father would look at you from the\#dark corner of your small hut. The eyes of a starving man.
You remember \c[2]Fast stance\c[0]!
You remember... How your father finally made his move during\#the full moon. But he was already so weak from the hunger.
You remember the wicked rituals your ancestors took part\#in. The crude old-fashioned witchcraft that lacked the\#finesse of it's modern counterpart.

"Freedom to choose our own destiny and build the future\#we deserve."
"Those who would set their foot inside, would end\#up in a forever-going turmoil of godly dimensions and\#planes of afterlife."
"The fellowship consisted of 5 people:\#Francóis - the dominating one,\#Nilvan - the endless one,\#Valteil - the enlightened one,"
"The tale of the fellowship is familiar to many\#but few know the factual story of which all the\#poems and songs are made of."
"Back then, there existed an ancient tomb to\#ancient city of Mahavre that worked as a hub for\#multiple different planes of existance. A place\#where a man could meet his maker."
"The fellowship chapter 1 -\#The following pages tell of the events that took place\#in the year 809 after the birth of our christ,\#the ascended one."
"Chambara - the tormented one,\#and then there was the fifth one - he who never aspired\#for the same greatness as the rest of the party - whose\#story bears no listeners. The forgotten one."
"The fellowship was formed to seek the older gods, who\#left humanity without guidance, without aid in the\#times of great peril."

"One of the Alll-mer's most trusted apostles, the one who\#would later be known as the Deceiving One betrayed his master\#and gave out his location to the forces that wanted Alll-mer\#gone."
"Alll-mer was captured and tortured. The newborn god was\#nailed onto a cross as a feast for the crows."
"Spending three days and three nights at the city of the\#gods - Ma'habre, he would then return among living.\#Alll-mer came back, not just to spread his gospel but also\#to extract his revenge."
"Alll-mer's martyr-like posture became a symbol of the\#times, as even the cross couldn't prevent his ascension\#to the heavens."
"The sultans and the kings of the time came to know his\#wrath. The biggest blood bath however was reserved for the\#apostle who deceived him."

Show love
Sacrifice \N[17]?
Sacrifice D'arce?
Sacrifice \N[18]?
Seriously!?
\N[16] seems completely fine with it.
Make love with Enki?
Sylvian
Sacrifice the unnamed fetus?
The girl is NOT willing.
But it appears \N[8] has no reproductive organs, so making\#love is not possible.
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"No way. NO WAY!"
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"Eeh, well that's a freaky suggestion, but fine."
Make love with Cahara?
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"If you want to keep holding to your head, I suggest\#you forget your plans here!"
\c[7]L'garde\c[0]\#"That's just not gonna happen. I have a grander purpose in\#life."
Unfortunately your reproductive organs fail to work in your\#current form.
Sacrifice Enki?
A ritual circle is drawn and carved here.
Make love with D'arce?
\c[7]Enki\c[0]\#"I can't believe what I'm saying, but let's do this."
\c[7]Ragnvaldr\c[0]\#"...Very well."
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"Gotta say that y'er probably the most beautiful man I have\#ever laid with."
Sacrifice your own child, \N[8]?
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"Sure thing."
Which god do you pray?
Make love with \N[21]?
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]\#"Make love?"
\N[20] has no flesh to make love to.
Ragnvaldr seems to think this course of action benefits you\#both in your survival.
\N[18] seems completely fine with it.
\N[17] is willing.
Sacrifice the girl?
Make love with \N[16]?
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"Listen, my standards aren't really high or anything, but\#now is not the time."
Sacrifice Cahara?
The helpless fetus breathes heavily as you put it down\#on the altar.
Sacrifice L'garde?
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"Ah... My lord."
Make love with \N[17]?
D'arce gives you a long smile.
Make love with the \N[12]?
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"I might be ready to die, but I'll go with my own terms when\#the time is right."
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]\#"Why of course."
Sacrifice your own child, \N[12]?
\N[19] seems completely fine with it.
\N[8] is clueless about your intentions.
Make love with Nas'hrah?
\N[17] seems completely fine with it.
With the sacrifice, your affinity with the Gro-goroth is\#growing...
\N[21] has no flesh to make love to.
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"This is something I have dreamed about, but-- Is this really\#the right time?"
\c[7]Enki\c[0]\#"To die for your benefit? Such a pitiful idea. I fail to\#take it even as an insult, let alone threat."
Make love
"You're right. Let's leave it for later."
\N[20] seems completely fine with it.
\N[12] is helpless, so it is an easy task.
\N[16] is willing.
Sacrifice \N[21]?
Sacrifice Ragnvaldr?
Sacrifice \N[19]?
\N[19] has no flesh to make love to.
Loving yourself produces no effects on ritual circle.
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]\#"TOO BAD NOTHING GETS ME AROUSED QUITE AS\#BURNT MEAT!"
The girl seems to struggle a little...
\c[7]Ragnvaldr\c[0]\#"..."
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"...Yes... let's do this."
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"But please be gentle. I have not laid with anyone before..."
\c[7]L'garde\c[0]\#"What? You go all your way to get me out, just to sacrifice\#me on this altar?"
Sacrifice \N[20]?
\N[8] is willing to do anything for you.
Sacrifice Nas'hrah?
Make love with \N[20]?
Make love with the \N[8]?
\c[7]Ragnvaldr\c[0]\#"...No."
\c[7]L'garde\c[0]\#"Not gonna happen."
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"Oh yeah! Let's do this."
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]\#"There're not many who rival my skills in this line of\#business."

"The fellowship persisted through the numerous hazards\#and dangers the older gods threw at them. Eventually all\#five of them would reach the golden gates of Mahavre, the\#very same gates Alll-mer ascended from 800 years prior."
"The forgotten one was the last trial the old gods had\#in store. His purpose in the grand scheme of things was\#to create doubt and unease between the fellowship."
"The fellowship tore down the legacy of the old gods and\#created a new world order. An age where mankind decided\#their own fate. An age of growth and prosperity."
"Holding tight to their grand mission, the fellowship\#prevailed however. They laid down all the doubts and\#proceeded to the golden temple of Mahavre."
"The fellowship became the new gods we know and love today."
"It seemed like the fellowship had bested all the\#challenges gods layed for them, but at the most crucial\#moment a seed of doubt was planted into the mind of the\#fifth one."
"The fellowship chapter 2 -\#The fellowship found their way to the ancient tombs that\#would lead them to their confrontation with the older gods."

"The grand lie told of the way the older gods directed the\#flow of mankind. That many had gone before the same trials\#as the fellowship. Yet nothing had changed for the better\#for men as eons went by."
"The forgotten one was never again seen or heard. The fifth\#one simply disappeared in the dusts of time..."
"The forgotten one was a scholar of many arts and sciences,\#and as such, believed what was laid before eyes. The Older\#gods would use this to their advantage and create a grand\#lie. A lie about the greater scheme of things."
"This suspicion created a drift between the fellowship.\#In the end the four other members proceeded with the\#initial mission, trusting fate and glory that was just\#inches away from them."
"The fellowship persisted through the numerous hazards\#and dangers the older gods threw at them. Eventually all\#five of them would reach the golden gates of Ma'habre, the\#very same gates Alll-mer ascended from 800 years prior."

"Chambara - the tormented one,\#and then there was the fifth one - she who never aspired\#for the same greatness as the rest of the party - whose\#story bears no listeners. The forgotten one."
"Back then, there existed an ancient tomb to\#ancient city of Ma'habre that worked as a hub for\#multiple different planes of existance. A place\#where a man could meet his maker."

\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He met the alchemist Nosramus on his way down who saved\#his life. The old knight decided to serve Nosramus for his\#lifetime and beyond."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Men are wicked. Condensed wickedness can manifest in many\#ways. Scarabs are there to remind us of this."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He travelled far from the east just to stop the spreading\#of the inevitable darkness."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"They came from the green hue. Even we don't know their\#true purpose."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The remaining guards of the fortress. They tried to save\#themselves with an act of love."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"It is a simple being created by a new god that once existed\#who was trying to achieve the power of the older gods with\#limited understanding."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Only traces of the older gods remain in this plane of\#existence. Nas'hrah has been able to bend a powerful being\#under his will."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Those mindless beasts only taste the blood of their victim\#in their mouth. That is all they know."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Long ago, before men took the dungeons as their own, there\#dwelled a different race in the black."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He was once persuaded by the king of the insects."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He is but a slave to Gro-goroth."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"A lone cave wolf who was once driven away from her pack\#because of her superior strength."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"A virtuous knight who was on a path to the black of the\#dungeons."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Before men, the lizardmen roamed as the dominating lifeform."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Creations of the black. The darkness has had its way with\#countless of victims."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The fool has travelled wide and far, but has gotten no\#wiser."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The poor creature wants to get the gift of the God of the\#Depths..."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"An act of love between a cave wolf and a guard."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"It is truly curious how powerful those ancient relics were\#in their true prime."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He used to lust to hurt women. Now he is an epitome of his\#perversions."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He who suffered the torture of the tormented one for\#hundreds of years. With every passing year its pain grows\#stronger."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The older gods, before their departure, nominated a king\#to rule the Ma'habre and mankind."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The miserable creation that is but mockery of human beings."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"What remains of those ancient times are the forms."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"An ancient being that swims in the underground waterways.\#There are many human legends which mention this beast as\#well."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The true of the old knight."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He turned on the god of the depths for salvation..."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Those ghastly figures are but echoes of the people that\#dwelled those dungeons before."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"A simple reanimated skeleton. The necromancy needs to be\#stronger in them to animate mere dust and bones, thus their\#strength is also greater than ghouls."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"It requires fertile ground to grow to its full bloom and\#there is no better source of life than humans."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Francóis the dominating one has trained the hunting hounds to\#harass all those who trespass his domain."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Ask anything you want to."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Overwhelming physical strength and endless lust that is\#only weakened by their loneliness. It manifests in their final\#form."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"His iron will manifests in his blade even to this day."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Pupils of the Nas'hrah the destroyer. They use the strength\#of the Gro-goroth to their master's advantage."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Needless to say that his pursuits are in vain."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Primal and savage beings. The poor souls were once stuck in\#the black because of a cave-in."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The black has its way of changing the nature of wolves."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Unable to satisfy the needs of his victims, he resorts\#to more violent ways of pleasure."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The wretched being was locked behind the sealed door when\#he was looting the dungeon from valuables."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He has seen millenia go by, but still the fool waits for\#a false prophecy."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Like us, they too desired to ascend higher."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Valteil the enlightened one, in his attempts to understand\#the secrets of life, he accidentally created this being."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Many of them saw end when the current reign in the dungeons\#ended just a brief time ago."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Cavemother, a being who has stayed in the darkness for too\#long. It longs for human kind to pregnate her."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Those whose physical and mental fortitude couldn't handle\#the ever-pressing darkness."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The priests came for the pilgrimage to the dungeons. They\#are worshippers of both new and older gods."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The figurine created by the older gods to protect the\#golden temple of the true king."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"\N[28]..."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He was once sentenced to the prisons."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He was set on purifying the dungeons from filth and\#deprivement. Little did he know that he would become a part\#of the black himself."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Greater blight is something that rivals the powers of the\#new gods even in this day and age."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"They are fully erect despite being left untouched for\#decades."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Uterus serves a purpose too and every night Valteil would\#summon one of them to his quarters."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"They lost their mind."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"It's all fallacy. We as the new gods rule the Ma'habre now."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Just like how the black changes the humans, it also affects\#the plants."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"What subject do you want to know more about?"
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"They manifest around sickness and dead carcasses."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"On this soil, that has seen countless death, that curious\#flower once started blooming."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"Valteil the enlightened one created many forms of life for\#many different purposes."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"He is a human that was lost to blood magic. The darkness\#has had its way with him."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The little halflings given birth by the Cavemother. Even\#their mother think little of them and uses them to do her\#dirty work."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"As things started to succumb to chaos in the dungeons of\#fear and hunger, he was sent from the Kingdom of Rondon for\#aid."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"In short time he too lost his mind. Now he tries to guard\#the area to his last breath from anyone who sets foot to the\#fortress."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"A manifestation of your grudge during your stay in the\#dungeons."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"The moon god has his motivations to meddle with the act in\#process, but we do not understand him."
\c[7]New gods\c[0]\#"We do not know much about her. She is the servant of the\#Moon god. The older one."

"- The pinecone pig is ready. Enjoy."
"- Take a well-kept pinecone. Push the sticks inside the\#openings on the pinecone. The sticks should be able to\#carry the weight of the pinecone, so they should be placed\#on all four sides of the bottom of the pinecone."
There are instructions on how to build your own pinecone\#pig - The amulet of good luck and fortune. The pinecone pig\#seems to originate from the north, from the little villages\#in the Oldegård.
"- First you need a narrow stick. Break it into four equally\#long pieces. Align them to each other to make sure they are\#the right size."
