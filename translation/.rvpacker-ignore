GabText You have travelled a great distance
GabText \N[1]...
Unfortunately the only class available in this demo\#version is Mercenary.
GabText Your journey has lead you to this wretched place.
GabText First, you must choose your profession
Dark Priest - Alchemy and ritual passages have gained\#you deeper knowledge of human nature. There is no right\#and wrong, only the way of the gods.
Knight - Righteous and discliplined. Following the path\#of the sword is as much about physical, as it is about\#mental strength. Excels in melee combat.
Mercenary - A warrior class that will do whatever it\#takes to see the light of the next day. There isn't\#a task you wouldn't undertake for a bag of silver coins.
GabText Please create your character
GabText in search of your former comrade in arms.
Caution! This game contains scenes of extreme\#violence  and gore. The game also covers themes of\#sexual violence, drug usage and child abuse.

Le'garde was taken as a captive and to be used most likely\#on propaganda.
You were born with the soul of domination that makes\#people around you bend to your will. You are a natural\#leader, but you might often end up blind to self-criticism.
You learn \c[2]Devour\c[0].
Stock up food for the mission
Eventually you lost your mind to the hunger and like a\#raging wolf you cried the night on the deck, while others\#feasted on the fallen.
As time went on, you proved out to be a gifted fighter and\#a valuable asset to the army of Rondon. However...
This trait already started showing itself at a very young\#age as you were chosen to become a dark priest upon the birth\#of you and your twin sister.
At this point family ties weighted no more than strangers\#you met at the dirty streets of Rondon. You completely cut\#ties with your family wihout hesitation.
You get a \c[2]Dried meat\c[0], a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0] and\#3 \c[2]Carrots\c[0].
From the dungeons of Fear and Hunger. The morbid place has\#been used as a wartime prison by the kingdom and for some\#reason they need an outside sword like yourself to infiltrate\#their very own stronghold.
You put your creativity to test in the most harshest of\#enviroments. You were born and soon abandoned in the capital\#of the Eastern Sanctuaries - Jettaiah.
He was the famous captain from the fabled mercenary army\#Knights of the Midnight Sun. You immediately packed and\#left after him. The man would witness the iron will tempered\#in the north and in the dark continent of Vinland.
Unfortunately the relics you brought from the trip tainted\#you and you formed a Panophobia, a fear of everything.
Stock up on equipment
Your life spent learning thievery certainly didn't go to\#waste. You learned to live with constant fear and danger\#over the years. The crude streets of Jettaiah teached you\#valuable lessons.
You learned that the man has since been imprisoned in the\#Kingdom of Rondons dungeons. In the notorious dungeons\#of Fear & Hunger.
A practice sparring match between you and a well seasoned\#squire took place at the central training grounds.
As the troops of the Rondon army marched towards your\#clearly smaller army, you had to choose which position\#to take in the coming encounter.
You stroke your dagger to the spine of your sister and she\#collapsed on the ground. You high priest masters seemed\#especially pleased with this and prepared you for your\#ascension ceremony.
With time you learned to understand the language they\#spoke. You learned \c[2]Mastery over insects\c[0].
You quietly left the temple area thinking that revenge\#doesn't solve anything, but in order to make sure you\#survive on your own you took some precious books to secure\#your wealth.
Listen to your family and stay as a holy knight.
You were born with the soul of the enlightened. You are\#always seeking restlessly for new knowledge and secrets\#hidden from common folk.
Raised your buckler in defence
Don't give in
Rush straight after him
You were finally granted a pass to the great libraries\#of the Kingdom of Rondon. You now had the collection of\#all known history and science at your grasp.
You decided to stock up before your travels.
Stock up on magical items
Your devotion was shaken. You were all but ready to retire\#from the army, but your family insisted - no, they demanded\#you to stay as a holy knight, or else you'd bring great\#shame to their noble family.
You get \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1\c[0].
After leaving the temple grounds, you vowed to become a\#dark priest by your own merits and prove your fate wrong.
Necrophobia
Your family gave you a gift of \c[2]20 Silver coins\c[0].
She however showed mercy and withdrew her dagger. She\#took steps away from you as your high priest masters glared\#gleefully at the event unfolding before their very eyes.
It was this small overblow that was enough of an excuse\#for the Kingdom of Rondon to turn common folks against\#Le'garde and justify his imprisonment.
You spent your last night in the kingdom...
As you grew older you took part in various mercenary armies\#and learned the dirtiest tricks to stay alive. You were taken\#in by a notorious veteran highwayman and you joined his little\#band of criminals and ex-soldiers.
You get a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0] and 2 \c[2]Cloth fragments\c[0].
Choose bow & arrows
The continent had never been touched by a civilized man.\#The land was tainted by ancient deities and gods you had\#never even heard of. The things you witnessed there left a\#mark in you that could never be washed away.
You get \c[2]4 Blue herbs\c[0], a \c[2]White vial\c[0] and\#\c[2]2 Cloth fragments\c[0].
In the ascension ceremony you were to resurrect your\#deceased sister with necromancy and use her as your ghoul.\#You did this and the cold corpse of your sister brought\#a smile to your otherwise emotionless face.
D'arce
You learn \c[2]Escape plan\c[0].
Set the temple on fire and leave
Unfortunate for you, you were born with a fragile body\#and your sister easily overpowered you and had her dagger\#on your neck waiting for the final blow.
You get 3 \c[2]Dried meat\c[0], a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0] and\#a \c[2]Cheese\c[0].
Training to become a squire was a harsh school that spared\#no one. No matter if you were from a noble origin or not.
The common folk was starting to gather around the\#charismatic leader Le'garde, who shared the humble origin\#similar to farmers and villagers alike. There was\#definitely something otherworldy in his stature.
You had a balanced childhood in the city of Oldegård with\#both of your parents always present. Your father taught you\#in the art of war. The very first step was to choose your\#weapon.
You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0].
The dark priests got no place for the weak, so you were\#thrown in an underground well. There you were meant to\#quietly wither away, but instead you fed on insects and other\#small critters that shared your fate down there.
You travelled across the western continent, learning of\#different gods, deities, blood magic and all known sciences.\#Your studies didn't come without their merits. You were\#acknowledged by the top scholars of the modern times.
You also get an itch in your groin area...
Enki
Stock up healing items for the mission
After your ascension to dark priesthood, you were to leave\#the temple grounds and learn of occult on your own in your\#dark pilgrimage.
Upon your return, you witnessed your home burning, your\#family slain and the artefact stolen. Those who survived\#the raid described the army and it's captain.
With the aid of your new slaves, you eventually grew strong\#enough to climb up the well. You creeped upstairs to the\#temple and noticed it was night time.
Strike your dagger to her spine while she walks away
As the weak met their fate, the rest indulged in the greatest\#sin...
You were born with the soul of the endless that makes you\#yearn for freedom and forces you to push your creativity to\#its limits.
You learn \c[2]Lockpicking\c[0].
Stock up on healing items
Something is clearly not right about this mission and you\#have felt nauseus since the the moment you agreed on the\#job. But you are short on silver and the reward is all that\#matters in the end.
Just as things seemed too dark, you saw a light in the\#darkness. You met a captain of a small mercenary army who\#seemed to share the same ill-will towards the Kingdom of\#Rondon as you.
The dungeons open before you... You won't leave the ruins\#without Le'garde. One way or another, you two will be\#reunited. Even if it requires you to give up on your\#principles.
You learned of a certain man who was propheticed to begin\#a new era for mankind. A man meant for greatness. But why\#would you need to share the spotlight of the gods with any\#mortal man?
Take the rear and manage defences.
Your army was growing fast in both size and influence in the\#western regions. The Kingdom of Rondon would first use your\#services to their own benefit, but soon saw you more as a\#possible threat to their modern reigns.
Before leaving for your desperate journey, you decided\#to stock up on equipment and items...
You knew you didn't have much time before he would be\#sentenced to death, so you had to act fast.
Don't touch anything and flee back to your ship
Even if it seemed like a suicide mission, you decided to\#save Le'garde from the prisons he was held in.
It was almost too much for you, when Le'garde decided to\#raid the northen capital Oldegård and slayed everyone who\#stood in the way between him and this mysterious ancient\#relic. You never understood it's importance.
Abandon your comrades
Like typical to such occult rites, you were pitted against\#your sibling with ritual daggers and challenged to fight\#each other to the death.
Pray for Alll-Mer
You learn \c[2]Bloodlust\c[0].
Winters grew colder and summers shorter, which resulted\#a great hunger in the north. The fine men of the Oldegård\#set sails to the unknown west in a desperate attempt to\#find food and riches to feed the people.
You get a \c[2]Short bow\c[0] and 5 \c[2]arrows\c[0].
You get also get a \c[2]Iron cuirass\c[0] and \c[2]Arm guards\c[0].
You learned \c[2]Fast stance\c[0].
Prophecies are only for those who are weak enough to bend\#to their sorry fates. You need to find this man and learn\#more. To your current knowledge, he would be found\#imprisoned at the notorious dungeons of Fear & Hunger.
You get a \c[2]Long sword\c[0] and an \c[2]Eagle crest shield\c[0].
Fight to the last breath
This is it. Your stairway to enlightenment. You are set\#to discover the ancient secrets this stronghold keeps and\#to reach the ultimate understanding of the greater scheme\#of things.
You learn \c[2]Dash\c[0].
You travelled across the land in your raids and eventually\#settled down in the Kingdom of Rondon where silver was\#loose as long as you were up for getting your knife dirty.
You get 3 \c[2]Iron arrows\c[0] and a \c[2]Bear trap\c[0].
One day you got an omnious task from the officials of the\#Kingdom of Rondon. You are to be paid well in silver to get\#a captain of a fabled mercenary army out of the dungeons\#of Rondon itself.
You get an \c[2]Iron mace\c[0] and a \c[2]Wooden buckler\c[0].
Devour your fallen comrades
You swallowed your grief and doubt and decided to stay as\#a holy knight. In the end you could try to fix things up\#from the inside, you figured.
You get a \c[2]Pipe\c[0] and \c[2]Opium powder\c[0].
Quietly leave and run away without revenge
Rush straight for your mission
Pray for Sylvian
Take souveniers from Vinland
Lead a honest life
You had grown into your manhood and aboarded the ship.\#After months of sailing, the sea saw no end and the crew\#was struggling for their life. Some laid weak under the\#deck while some embraced the cold dark sea.
Go drinking and get laid at the brothel
During one of your many raids, your brigade got ambushed.\#The odds were seriously against you. You could have just\#abandoned your comrades and kept you life, or you could have\#fought to your last breath.
Vengeful in how you had been treated, you set the temple on\#fire, jammed the exit door so no one could escape and then\#ran away. Only muffled screams could be heard coming from\#the temple.
Spearhead the coming assault.
You learned \c[2]Defence stance\c[0].
Stock up on intoxicants
Break ties with your family and run away.
You get a \c[2]7 Tinderboxes\c[0], a \c[2]Quill\c[0]\#and a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Steal\c[0].
You get an \c[2]Iron spear\c[0].
You struggled through your early life, but managed to get\#by as a merchant of sorts. Your skills of haggling and\#speech improved over the years and you also managed to\#gather some savings.
Not many survived the ambush, but that just meant that the\#mission rewards got less takers. You were one of the lucky\#ones.
If your birth sign wasn't enough to warrant a future of\#greatness, you were also born into a wealthy noble family.\#At an early age you were sent into training to become\#a holy knight of Kingdom of Rondon.
An ancient artefact was brought from the dark continent.\#You knew it was a mistake, but the choice wasn't in your\#hands. While you were hunting, away from home, a mercenary\#army raided your village.
However your endless soul yearned for more...\#You couldn't just become a family man, grow fat and make\#a living as a mere merchant. You were destined for more.
You were born with the soul of the tormented. You are\#destined to struggle in every step you take in life, but\#this just ultimately makes you stronger physically and tempers\#your iron will that rivals the will of the gods themselves.
Choose mace and shield
So even if the mission was to go south for some reason,\#you are not going to return empty handed.
Just as you were about to flee from the army, things took\#an unexpected turn for you. You met a captain of a small\#mercenary army who seemed to share the same ill-will towards\#the Kingdom of Rondon as you.
Something changed with Le'garde as well. He kept more to\#himself and studied ancient texts and occult. He became\#obsessed with some relics and artefacts that gave you omnious\#feelings and terrible nightmares.
Ruthlessly the kingdom would expand it's reign.\#Reducing the feeble citadels to ashes and blood stains.\#Enslaving the sweet women folk whilst every man is slain.\#Only spare a child or two, that it's legend may grow.
Many of your comrades were slain, but you managed to escape\#the battlefield.
Pray for God of the Depths
You get also get a \c[2]Plate mail\c[0] and \c[2]Leg guards\c[0].
You get \c[2]30 Silver coins\c[0].
You get a \c[2]Wine vial\c[0], a \c[2]Bottle of whiskey\c[0]\#and an \c[2]Ale\c[0].
You set your mind - You will kill everything that carries\#a dark soul in the dungeons, you will have your revenge\#and the dark artefact will be yours again. There is no\#other way.
As if the trip wasn't dark enough, when you finally found\#land, it was something no one in the civilized world could\#ever imagine. From the far reaches of the world you found the\#dark continent of Vinland.
Le'garde saw potential in you and with warm words, he\#almost seduced you to join his band of mercenaries. Thanks\#to your rigorous discipline, you took a high position in\#his army, the Knight of the Midnight Sun.
Accept your defeat
Some of your comrades lost their minds while others tried to\#pillage anything worthwhile before leaving the macabre place.
You get a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0].
Your life spend learning thievery certainly didn't go to\#waste. You learned to live with constant fear and danger\#over the years. The crude streets of Jettaiah teached you\#valuable lessons.
The Knights of the Midnight Sun lost the fight.

Quickly stepped aside and dodged it
You had to choose at a very young age to either become a\#pickpocket, a burglar or try to struggle and lead a honest\#life.
This really is your make-or-break mission. There is a person\#back in the city relying on you to return with riches. You\#have heard rumours about this place and you are sure that\#there are great treasures hidden somewhere in these ruins...
The Kingdom of Rondon claimed to follow the will of the\#gods in it's pursuit for more power. But all the rewards\#seemed to fall into the laps of the elite and noble sitting\#comformtably behind the castle walls.

When beginning your self-studies, you first had to choose\#the god you'd dedicate your time to.
It is said that a fighter shows their true colours in their\#first fight. This applied to you too. When you saw the\#sword coming your way, you...
