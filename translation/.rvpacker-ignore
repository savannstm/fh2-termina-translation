Upon your return, you witnessed your home burning, your\#family slain and the artefact stolen. Those who survived\#the raid described the army and it's captain.
The Kingdom of Rondon claimed to follow the will of the\#gods in it's pursuit for more power. But all the rewards\#seemed to fall into the laps of the elite and noble sitting\#comformtably behind the castle walls.
Winters grew colder and summers shorter, which resulted\#a great hunger in the north. The fine men of the Oldegård\#set sails to the unknown west in a desperate attempt to\#find food and riches to feed the people.
Rush straight for your mission
You learn \c[2]Lockpicking\c[0].
You had to choose at a very young age to either become a\#pickpocket, a burglar or try to struggle and lead a honest\#life.
You get also get a \c[2]Iron cuirass\c[0] and \c[2]Arm guards\c[0].
You learned of a certain man who was propheticed to begin\#a new era for mankind. A man meant for greatness. But why\#would you need to share the spotlight of the gods with any\#mortal man?
If your birth sign wasn't enough to warrant a future of\#greatness, you were also born into a wealthy noble family.\#At an early age you were sent into training to become\#a holy knight of Kingdom of Rondon.
The Knights of the Midnight Sun lost the fight.
You decided to stock up before your travels.
Le'garde saw potential in you and with warm words, he\#almost seduced you to join his band of mercenaries. Thanks\#to your rigorous discipline, you took a high position in\#his army, the Knight of the Midnight Sun.
Stock up on equipment
Some of your comrades lost their minds while others tried to\#pillage anything worthwhile before leaving the macabre place.
It is said that a fighter shows their true colours in their\#first fight. This applied to you too. When you saw the\#sword coming your way, you...
Just as you were about to flee from the army, things took\#an unexpected turn for you. You met a captain of a small\#mercenary army who seemed to share the same ill-will towards\#the Kingdom of Rondon as you.
Your life spend learning thievery certainly didn't go to\#waste. You learned to live with constant fear and danger\#over the years. The crude streets of Jettaiah teached you\#valuable lessons.
You struggled through your early life, but managed to get\#by as a merchant of sorts. Your skills of haggling and\#speech improved over the years and you also managed to\#gather some savings.
You had grown into your manhood and aboarded the ship.\#After months of sailing, the sea saw no end and the crew\#was struggling for their life. Some laid weak under the\#deck while some embraced the cold dark sea.
You quietly left the temple area thinking that revenge\#doesn't solve anything, but in order to make sure you\#survive on your own you took some precious books to secure\#your wealth.
Listen to your family and stay as a holy knight.
You get an \c[2]Iron mace\c[0] and a \c[2]Wooden buckler\c[0].
At this point family ties weighted no more than strangers\#you met at the dirty streets of Rondon. You completely cut\#ties with your family wihout hesitation.
Stock up on healing items
You travelled across the western continent, learning of\#different gods, deities, blood magic and all known sciences.\#Your studies didn't come without their merits. You were\#acknowledged by the top scholars of the modern times.
The continent had never been touched by a civilized man.\#The land was tainted by ancient deities and gods you had\#never even heard of. The things you witnessed there left a\#mark in you that could never be washed away.
You get \c[2]30 Silver coins\c[0].
You get a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0] and 2 \c[2]Cloth fragments\c[0].
After leaving the temple grounds, you vowed to become a\#dark priest by your own merits and prove your fate wrong.
When beginning your self-studies, you first had to choose\#the god you'd dedicate your time to.
You put your creativity to test in the most harshest of\#enviroments. You were born and soon abandoned in the capital\#of the Eastern Sanctuaries - Jettaiah.
You stroke your dagger to the spine of your sister and she\#collapsed on the ground. You high priest masters seemed\#especially pleased with this and prepared you for your\#ascension ceremony.
Unfortunately the relics you brought from the trip tainted\#you and you formed a Panophobia, a fear of everything.
The dark priests got no place for the weak, so you were\#thrown in an underground well. There you were meant to\#quietly wither away, but instead you fed on insects and other\#small critters that shared your fate down there.
Don't give in
Just as things seemed too dark, you saw a light in the\#darkness. You met a captain of a small mercenary army who\#seemed to share the same ill-will towards the Kingdom of\#Rondon as you.
Rush straight after him
You get a \c[2]Dried meat\c[0], a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0] and\#3 \c[2]Carrots\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Bloodlust\c[0].
However your endless soul yearned for more...\#You couldn't just become a family man, grow fat and make\#a living as a mere merchant. You were destined for more.
Take souveniers from Vinland
As if the trip wasn't dark enough, when you finally found\#land, it was something no one in the civilized world could\#ever imagine. From the far reaches of the world you found the\#dark continent of Vinland.
Choose mace and shield
You get a \c[2]Long sword\c[0] and an \c[2]Eagle crest shield\c[0].
So even if the mission was to go south for some reason,\#you are not going to return empty handed.
You learned \c[2]Defence stance\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Escape plan\c[0].
Unfortunate for you, you were born with a fragile body\#and your sister easily overpowered you and had her dagger\#on your neck waiting for the final blow.
You get a \c[2]Pipe\c[0] and \c[2]Opium powder\c[0].
Vengeful in how you had been treated, you set the temple on\#fire, jammed the exit door so no one could escape and then\#ran away. Only muffled screams could be heard coming from\#the temple.
Your army was growing fast in both size and influence in the\#western regions. The Kingdom of Rondon would first use your\#services to their own benefit, but soon saw you more as a\#possible threat to their modern reigns.
You get a \c[2]Short bow\c[0] and 5 \c[2]arrows\c[0].
Accept your defeat
You get \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1\c[0].
Spearhead the coming assault.
Strike your dagger to her spine while she walks away
Choose bow & arrows
You learn \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
You were born with the soul of the endless that makes you\#yearn for freedom and forces you to push your creativity to\#its limits.
Pray for Sylvian
An ancient artefact was brought from the dark continent.\#You knew it was a mistake, but the choice wasn't in your\#hands. While you were hunting, away from home, a mercenary\#army raided your village.
Quickly stepped aside and dodged it
After your ascension to dark priesthood, you were to leave\#the temple grounds and learn of occult on your own in your\#dark pilgrimage.
You get also get a \c[2]Plate mail\c[0] and \c[2]Leg guards\c[0].
You get a \c[2]7 Tinderboxes\c[0], a \c[2]Quill\c[0]\#and a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0].
With the aid of your new slaves, you eventually grew strong\#enough to climb up the well. You creeped upstairs to the\#temple and noticed it was night time.
You had a balanced childhood in the city of Oldegård with\#both of your parents always present. Your father taught you\#in the art of war. The very first step was to choose your\#weapon.
Many of your comrades were slain, but you managed to escape\#the battlefield.
Even if it seemed like a suicide mission, you decided to\#save Le'garde from the prisons he was held in.
She however showed mercy and withdrew her dagger. She\#took steps away from you as your high priest masters glared\#gleefully at the event unfolding before their very eyes.
Break ties with your family and run away.
You spent your last night in the kingdom...
You knew you didn't have much time before he would be\#sentenced to death, so you had to act fast.
The common folk was starting to gather around the\#charismatic leader Le'garde, who shared the humble origin\#similar to farmers and villagers alike. There was\#definitely something otherworldy in his stature.
Something changed with Le'garde as well. He kept more to\#himself and studied ancient texts and occult. He became\#obsessed with some relics and artefacts that gave you omnious\#feelings and terrible nightmares.
You get a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0].
You travelled across the land in your raids and eventually\#settled down in the Kingdom of Rondon where silver was\#loose as long as you were up for getting your knife dirty.
You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0].
You were born with the soul of the tormented. You are\#destined to struggle in every step you take in life, but\#this just ultimately makes you stronger physically and tempers\#your iron will that rivals the will of the gods themselves.
As the weak met their fate, the rest indulged in the greatest\#sin...
Go drinking and get laid at the brothel
Don't touch anything and flee back to your ship
Fight to the last breath
As you grew older you took part in various mercenary armies\#and learned the dirtiest tricks to stay alive. You were taken\#in by a notorious veteran highwayman and you joined his little\#band of criminals and ex-soldiers.
You get \c[2]4 Blue herbs\c[0], a \c[2]White vial\c[0] and\#\c[2]2 Cloth fragments\c[0].
Abandon your comrades
Pray for Gro-goroth
Prophecies are only for those who are weak enough to bend\#to their sorry fates. You need to find this man and learn\#more. To your current knowledge, he would be found\#imprisoned at the notorious dungeons of Fear & Hunger.
Like typical to such occult rites, you were pitted against\#your sibling with ritual daggers and challenged to fight\#each other to the death.
Set the temple on fire and leave
You swallowed your grief and doubt and decided to stay as\#a holy knight. In the end you could try to fix things up\#from the inside, you figured.
You learned that the man has since been imprisoned in the\#Kingdom of Rondons dungeons. In the notorious dungeons\#of Fear & Hunger.
You get an \c[2]Iron spear\c[0].
One day you got an omnious task from the officials of the\#Kingdom of Rondon. You are to be paid well in silver to get\#a captain of a fabled mercenary army out of the dungeons\#of Rondon itself.
Necrophobia
You set your mind - You will kill everything that carries\#a dark soul in the dungeons, you will have your revenge\#and the dark artefact will be yours again. There is no\#other way.
He was the famous captain from the fabled mercenary army\#Knights of the Midnight Sun. You immediately packed and\#left after him. The man would witness the iron will tempered\#in the north and in the dark continent of Vinland.
D'arce
Training to become a squire was a harsh school that spared\#no one. No matter if you were from a noble origin or not.
You learn \c[2]Steal\c[0].
With time you learned to understand the language they\#spoke. You learned \c[2]Mastery over insects\c[0].
You learn \c[2]Devour\c[0].
It was almost too much for you, when Le'garde decided to\#raid the northen capital Oldegård and slayed everyone who\#stood in the way between him and this mysterious ancient\#relic. You never understood it's importance.
This really is your make-or-break mission. There is a person\#back in the city relying on you to return with riches. You\#have heard rumours about this place and you are sure that\#there are great treasures hidden somewhere in these ruins...
Stock up healing items for the mission
You learn \c[2]Dash\c[0].
From the dungeons of Fear and Hunger. The morbid place has\#been used as a wartime prison by the kingdom and for some\#reason they need an outside sword like yourself to infiltrate\#their very own stronghold.
As the troops of the Rondon army marched towards your\#clearly smaller army, you had to choose which position\#to take in the coming encounter.
A practice sparring match between you and a well seasoned\#squire took place at the central training grounds.
You get a \c[2]Wine vial\c[0], a \c[2]Bottle of whiskey\c[0]\#and an \c[2]Ale\c[0].
During one of your many raids, your brigade got ambushed.\#The odds were seriously against you. You could have just\#abandoned your comrades and kept you life, or you could have\#fought to your last breath.
Quietly leave and run away without revenge
You were born with the soul of domination that makes\#people around you bend to your will. You are a natural\#leader, but you might often end up blind to self-criticism.
This trait already started showing itself at a very young\#age as you were chosen to become a dark priest upon the birth\#of you and your twin sister.
You get 3 \c[2]Dried meat\c[0], a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0] and\#a \c[2]Cheese\c[0].
Lead a honest life
Raised your buckler in defence
It was this small overblow that was enough of an excuse\#for the Kingdom of Rondon to turn common folks against\#Le'garde and justify his imprisonment.
Stock up on magical items
As time went on, you proved out to be a gifted fighter and\#a valuable asset to the army of Rondon. However...
Pray for God of the Depths
Ragnvaldr
Before leaving for your desperate journey, you decided\#to stock up on equipment and items...
Enki
Eventually you lost your mind to the hunger and like a\#raging wolf you cried the night on the deck, while others\#feasted on the fallen.
Devour your fallen comrades
Your devotion was shaken. You were all but ready to retire\#from the army, but your family insisted - no, they demanded\#you to stay as a holy knight, or else you'd bring great\#shame to their noble family.
Stock up food for the mission
Your life spent learning thievery certainly didn't go to\#waste. You learned to live with constant fear and danger\#over the years. The crude streets of Jettaiah teached you\#valuable lessons.
You also get an itch in your groin area...
You were born with the soul of the enlightened. You are\#always seeking restlessly for new knowledge and secrets\#hidden from common folk.
Something is clearly not right about this mission and you\#have felt nauseus since the the moment you agreed on the\#job. But you are short on silver and the reward is all that\#matters in the end.
Cahara
You learned \c[2]Fast stance\c[0].
This is it. Your stairway to enlightenment. You are set\#to discover the ancient secrets this stronghold keeps and\#to reach the ultimate understanding of the greater scheme\#of things.
Take the rear and manage defences.
Not many survived the ambush, but that just meant that the\#mission rewards got less takers. You were one of the lucky\#ones.
Your family gave you a gift of \c[2]20 Silver coins\c[0].
In the ascension ceremony you were to resurrect your\#deceased sister with necromancy and use her as your ghoul.\#You did this and the cold corpse of your sister brought\#a smile to your otherwise emotionless face.
The dungeons open before you... You won't leave the ruins\#without Le'garde. One way or another, you two will be\#reunited. Even if it requires you to give up on your\#principles.
Pray for Alll-Mer
Ruthlessly the kingdom would expand it's reign.\#Reducing the feeble citadels to ashes and blood stains.\#Enslaving the sweet women folk whilst every man is slain.\#Only spare a child or two, that it's legend may grow.
Stock up on intoxicants
Le'garde was taken as a captive and to be used most likely\#on propaganda.
You were finally granted a pass to the great libraries\#of the Kingdom of Rondon. You now had the collection of\#all known history and science at your grasp.
You get 3 \c[2]Iron arrows\c[0] and a \c[2]Bear trap\c[0].

GabText You hit the hound and manage to kill it!
You search the barrel for anything useful...
A dead horse is laying down here.
Your child is dead now...
A pile of planks. They've been left at mercy of the weather\#for quite some time.
\c[7]Le'garde\c[0]\#"I still have unfinished business in the darkness..."
You take the baby with you.
\c[7]Le'garde\c[0]\#"So you are about to leave?"
"I must leave this place."
You could use \c[2]Demon seed\c[0] on the cavewolf.
A wild hound lies dead on the ground.

\c[7]The Merchant\c[0]\#"A little bird told me that these dungeons just swallowed\#a new set of poor bastards."
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]\#"Fine. I'll go with you."
