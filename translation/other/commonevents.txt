As you finish reading the book, it crumbles into dust\#before your very eyes.
The book contains traditional recipes dating back to the 15th\#century cuisine.
The recipes are collected from the memoirs of the infamous\#chef Andérs that worked at the royal kitchen of Rondon at the\#time.
It appears that chef Andérs gained infamy by seducing court\#ladies and was even rumoured to had a fling with the princess\#Elizabeth, the famous virgin princess.
Now that you look at it, the book seems to be more about royal\#gossip than food recipes...
Between all this romance and betreyal you find recipes of\#chef Andérs' famous \c[2]Meatpie\c[0] and \c[2]Vegetable pie\c[0]!
"What backwater parts these dark corners of the earth really\#are!"
"When I heard about this assignment, I figured the city of\#Prehevil was at least decent sized and there would surely\#be some entertainment to be had with the local dancers and\#street girls."
"But alas, I'm not too keen on getting that comfy with the\#locals after sightseeing the city a bit..."
"Frankly I'm baffled at how a city of this size has managed\#to stay so isolated from the neighbouring influences and\#modern times."
"The Prehevil folk still hold on tightly to religious rites\#as old as 'The Fellowship' itself."
"The human sacrifices creep me out in this day and age. Even\#if I've seen the horrors of war, the crucifixes set around\#the city manage to send a chill down my spine."
"The sights of Ma'habre. You have seen them too, haven't\#you? In your dreams you wander for one lifetime with\#silhoutte of this city in horizon.
"You have seen the twin towers that rise next to\#a black night sky. Those macabre obelisks telling tales\#of some older, more cruel age.
"You have seen the grand gate with it's maddening\#murals and spirals. Patterns beyond understanding."
"It's not like the sound of wind, howling between\#those hollow streets wasn't enough..."
"You also hear the sound of local residents. Even while\#all comphrehension would dictate that this place is\#long abandoned..."
"...You still hear them. You are not alone in this\#vile part of world."
"In your dreams you have seen it, haven't you?\#The city of Ma'habre. The city of gods."
"Did you know it exists here?"
"Gro-goroth - The destroyer of men. He who ushers a new dawn\#with force and violence."
"Gro-goroth is the other part of the most primal duality.\#Creation and destruction. Where the other doesn't exist\#without the other."
"The word 'destruction' is often associated with the evil of\#the world. This of course is foolishness. There is no room\#for new creation if the slate is not first burnt clean and\#empty."
"A man fears destruction. Man gets accustomed to peace and\#quiet. Man grows fat and afraid of change."
"Change is inevitable, just as Gro-goroth."
"What one needs to understand is that the destruction is of\#pure kind. It does not target one man specifically. It just\#exists."
"Gro-goroth is associated with the the god of creation, Sylvian\#and their child, the god of the nature, Vinushka."
"Gro-goroth offers the mankind the blessing of blood magick.\#Constant sacrifices in his name will maintain the relationship."
"The Mark of Gro-goroth raises the physical strength of its\#wearer."
The text includes the sigil of the Gro-goroth and instructions\#on how to use it.
"Very much like the sun - the moon is one of the primordial entities \#and thus it has lore and beliefs written since the dawn of time."
"This makes it difficult to separate facts from fiction and mad\#ramblings from hidden truths."
"Consistent details among the myriad of stories seem to hint of a\#god called Rher. Also knowns as the Trickster God and the Moon God."
"In the most ancient of writings Rher is depicted as the god of the\#insane and those who've succumbed to the madness."
"His blessing to men is his moonlight, which is said to uncover the\#truth under the human filth. A truth that is often too much for a\#human mind to handle."
"It can be debated whether his version of the truth is more accurate\#than that of the human filth."
"Unlike many of the other older gods, Rher's part in the greater\#scheme of things remains a mystery."
"Just looking at the night sky, you can see his presence, in an\#eternal slumber. This makes his secrecy even more infuriating, he\#is literally hiding in plain sight."
"The Mark of Rher raises the maximum capacity of the mind."
The text includes the sigil of the Rher and instructions on how\#to use it.
"The Intermediate Level of Alchemy - Alchemillia vol.2"
"The effects of different coloured alchemic substances are listed\#here:"
"Yellow + Oil = Highly flammable"\#Blue + Fly Amanita = Antidote for the poison\#Golden chantarelle + Golden chantarelle = Nutritious liquid."
"Conceived by the black. Born from the clay. Shaped by\#our fears. Forged by the sins of her parents."
"From eternal darkness and void, she'd bring gloom."
"The hubris of man brought this upon us, but it is not\#because of cruelty, it is because of wisdom. Only through\#hardship could we see the errors of our ways."
The book radiates light in every color of the spectrum.
You feel like your journey has just began. As if your existence\#since this very moment has been like watching someone else\#entirely.
You feel a perspective shift in your surroundings. As if\#everything was to shrink, or perhaps you were to ascend\#higher.
You gain better understanding of yourself. The link between\#your mind and body has started it's deterioration.
You feel closer to enlightenment.

"-The Tale of the Pocketcat -\#"This is a tale about the Pocketcat, the friend of the children, but\#only a friend, nothing more."
"Willem, the wildest child known to the little town of Merwood spent\#another afternoon watching raindrops dance against the window."
"It had been raining without a stop for the whole week and Willem, the\#restless boy he was, grew even more restless."
"His mother would warn him of going outside during an usettled weather.\#The rain brings forth all kinds of dangers otherwise unknown to little\#boys."
"Besides decent children would help their parents with various\#household chores during this kind of dreich."
"Willem, the restless boy he was, disregarded the warnings and slipped\#out without a worry in the world."
"He dashed through the bushes and ran deep in the heart of the Merwood."
"The first horror to befall on him was a two-day-old carcass of a once\#beautiful deer, now defiled by the pest of the forest floor devouring\#its remains."
"The second horror poor little Willem witnessed was an age-old slowworm\#caught in the middle of an ant colony. Slowly the slowworm sank deeper\#and deeper to its inevitable doom as the ant nest consumed it torso."
"In the heart of the forest, all wet from the rain, Willem\#heard slight panting noices from an overgrown grotto nearby..."
"Cautiously Willem peeked through the leaves..."
"He would not believe his eyes when he saw a finely dressed\#cat standing on two feet, twice as tall as Willem's father\#would be."
"The cat's back was facing Willem. Its hand was moving\#swiftly inside its pocket while the two big yellow eyes\#glee'd inside a burlap bag in great excitement."
"Suddenly the hand movement came to a halt."
"Even if Willem was well hidden behind the leaves - slowly\#the cat turned it's eyes towards him."
"In terror Willem ran as fast as he could towards his home!"
"The two glowing yellow eyes of the cat haunted him all the\#way to his home gates."
"His mother was there to meet him by the front door.\#'So you just had to go to the woods, did you?' - said\#his mother."
"'You saw something you shouldn't have, right!?' - questioned\#his mother. 'And how do I know this?'"
"Willem's mother would go inside to get a little parcel with\#decorated wrappings."
"'This appeared on the front door just before you came.\#It was directed to young mister Willem.'"
"Slowly Willem unwrapped the decorated paper with small\#mouse prints on it..."
"Inside the parcel, there was catnip."
"The New Poems of Love and Torment -\#Written by Ronn Chambara"
"The book contains age-old writings of the famed poet\#Ronn Chambara. This book concentrates on the latter half\#of his lifetime and production."
"Poem I - 'The blackened heart'\#Stakes are high, you are also and more so -\#Live your lie and play with my blood torso."
"Who would believe all your tries -\#To blacken my name, dead crow as a prize."
"They say that a tear, only dries -\#So I want to see the day, even Gro-goroth cries."
"They will come know this day as the cruel age."
"They will come know this page as the fourth phase."
"Won't you die."
"-The Four Ages of Modern History-"\#"The modern age and modern chronology begins from the birth\#of our lord , the ascended one, Alll-mer."
"There are many fabricated religious text about Alll-mer, but\#there is enough evidence to prove that Alll-mer did indeed\#exist as a real person at the time.
"His birth would mark as the first age. The second age started\#from the reign of the so-called New gods in the year 410."
"There are texts about different new gods prior to this event,\#and the concept did exist in ancient times as well, but this\#group of people included the famed warlord from the Eastern\#Sanctuaries, Nash'rah the great."
"This alone made this group more distinguished compared to\#the ones that came before."
"Their world order started a slow decline few hundred years\#after their deaths, only to be ended by 'The fellowship'\#around year 800."
"The popular book 'The Fellowship' inspired the comtemporary\#people of the time and lifted the four people of the fellowship -\#Francóis, Chambara, Nilvan and Valteil to a near god-like status.
"Their age would last until the end of the 16th century.\#The western world was in a dark age at the time and out of\#nowhere appeared a new idol of worship, the god of Fear\#& Hunger."
"People forgot the teachings of the old in times of diseases\#and death and turned on to this new saviour."

"This manual depicts basics of survival in a close-combat situations,\#as well as on the field. The following teachings can be applied both\#on the battlefield and in your everyday life."
"\c[2]Lesson 1 - Strategic Dismemberment\c[0]\#Sever different limbs of the enemy to best subdue their attacks.\#If the enemy is carrying a weapon, it might be best to deal with\#that particular limb first."
"Going straight for the head might seem tempting, but attacking such\#guarded bodypart in the heat of the battle might prove out to be\#difficult."
"Taking out legs will often rock the balance of the enemy and make\#them vulnerable for head shots."
"\c[2]Lesson 2 - Rev Up\c[0]\#As the fight goes on, you will get more rev'd up naturally as\#indicated with your \i[175] Points increasing every turn."
"Use one or two \i[175] Points to boost your strength, or three to\#add an additional attack to your string."
"There are also different skills that require Rev Points. These are\#mentioned in the skill descriptions."
"\c[2]Lesson 3 - Devastating Attacks\c[0]\#Sometimes the enemy might be preparing for a Devastating Attack.\#These attacks cause massive damage or other status ailments that\#prove out to be insufferable."
"Most of the time these attacks are telegraphed somehow on the\#previous turn and you can see them coming. You can either dodge\#Devastating Attacks by guarding or you can risk it and face the\#Coin of Judgement."
"The Coin of Judgement is your last chance in dodging the incoming\#attack. You can affect your chances by throwing a \c[2]Lucky coin\c[0] into\#the mix by holding [SHIFT] key while you choose either Heads or\#Tails."
"Ultimately your fate will be chosen by the higher powers."
"\c[2]Lesson 4 - Shooting\c[0]\#You can use various different firearms on the field, before even\#initiating a combat encounter, to weaken or to kill the enemy before\#they get to the striking distance."
"Just have a firearm equipped, some ammo to spare and press [SHIFT].\#The effects of your attack vary from enemy to enemy. Weaker foes\#might even get killed from a single hit."
"\c[2]Lesson 5 - Running\c[0]\#Hold [SHIFT] to run. Running slowly depletes your stamina. If you\#run out of stamina entirely, you'll need a short recovery time to\#catch your breath before being able to run again."
"If an enemy spots you, you will go into Tension mode where stamina\#depletes at an alarming rate. This tense moment will luckily pass by\#fairly fast."
"If you have firearms equipped, you can't run. No running and\#gunning. If you have injured your legs, no running either."
"There is a lot more to survival, but hopefully these lessons will\#aid you to get started. Good luck."
It is a week-old newspaper article about the supposed end of\#the Great War II.
"...Two of the biggest powers in the western world - The\#Eastern Union and the Bremen settled for peace after the last\#aggressive push by the Bremen troops happening just days prior\#to the treaty."
"The Bremen troops seized the power in a small city of\#Prehevil, located in central Bohemia, just west from Lake\#Verdite."
"The last push was considered especially aggressive and it\#is widely considered to have advanced the peace agreements\#on a larger scale."
"Another major factor behind the peace was the joined assaults\#against the Eastern Union on both the western and eastern\#fronts."
"From the west, the remnants of the Kingdom of Rondon kept\#attacking the Eastern Union and from the east, the Kingdom of\#Edo continued their campaign after their prior defeats..."
The article goes on and on about the small details, but that\#seems to be the gist of the article.
The letter is encrypted by someone from the Nameless Liberty\#Underground. It uses the same code language taught to you at\#the NLU headquarters. You take a closer look...
"Eastern Union officials from both Voroniyan Republic as well\#as from Eastern Sanctuaries don't understand what they are giving\#up."
"I tried to emphasize the importance of the project Logic during\#my time with the research, yet they cannot see its true potential.\#Eastern Union is willing to let go of Prehevil for a very cheap\#price."
"The leaked documents say the officials are stupid enough to\#think they even got a good deal out of it. They don't understand\#what they are handing over to Kaiser on a silver platter."
"But Kaiser knows."
"I first met him briefly during my scholarship at the compound\#all those years ago. It sounds like Kaiser knows perfectly well\#what the project has been building towards..."
"...in fact from the pieces I was able to gather, it sounds\#like he was one of the main forces kickstarting the project long\#before The Great War started and pitted Bremen and Eastern Union\#against each other. -R"
Looks like a coded letter... Or a child's prank.
Unfortunately you do not have the means to decrypt this at the\#moment...

"The Last Frontier - The Vinland Coloniale - Chapter 1."
"The legends report that in the year 1009 a group of\#explorers from Oldegård first made contact with the island\#region of Vinland."
"This is the first written record of the continent. The\#next confirmed case dates back to year 1310 when a small\#fleet from Abyssonia ventured to the dark waters of the\#west."
"However it would take another 200 years before an\#established trade route would be formed, again by the\#seafarers of Oldegård in the year 1577."
"It was during this escapade that the continent was named\#Vinland, translating to 'Wine Land' supposedly because of\#the amount of wine required to wipe the memories clean of\#the land and the horrors it contained."
"Despite the existence of the continent becoming more\#common knowledge among the scholars of the western world,\#ventures to the said land were very rare."
"In the year 1650, a scholar from the Vatican City wrote\#the following description of the land:"
"The soil consists of minerals that seem to reject sunlight\#and warmth altogether resulting the ground to look like\#a contiguous colourless black mass where it is hard to\#measure depth of each hill and basin with a naked eye."
"And the few plants that manage to grow in this hostile\#ground end up taking these very same features. Thus the\#landscape merges together as far as the eye can see."
"Just endless darkness. If you are lucky, the clouds might\#shift a little and you can at the very least tell where\#the land ends and where the gloomy sky begins."
"The land is cursed. The land is morbid and dark."
"Each settler comes back with vivid stories of very personal\#nightmares they went through during their stay in Vinland."
"The discovery of this continent is the biggest mistake\#the mankind has ever made."
"James, it happened again. Those kids stole the tools for the\#umpteenth time! If I ever catch them in act, there's going to be\#hell to pay."
"The priest told me that everyone under the ascended one share all\#possession. 'Nothing is mine and nothing is yours. All is that of\#Alll-mer.'"
"What mumbo jumbo! That might work for the priest and all, but\#he's not the one doing these renovations under a strict schedule!"
"In future I'll hide the tool box. I got the perfect spot in\#mind already."
"When you enter the second hall, you know those statues? They are\#pointing, one to another. Just follow their lead. The last one\#points at the spot near the wall. I'll leave the box under the\#floor tiling there."
"Also, just to make it more difficult for those thieving little\#rats, I decided it's best to close the underground passage to the\#renovation site."
"Father Domek took one of the key effigies to his orphanage, one\#was left for the priests here and I'll take the last one to my\#own apartment."
"So if you need to use the passage, let me know."

"The Midnight Gazette, January 31, 1936\#Appointment of Kaiser as Bremen chancellor has been made\#official today."
"In approximately 14 years Kaiser has brought into being the\#greatest popular movement Bremen has ever seen. In fact one\#of the greatest that history registers."
"This mysterious man who seems to remain in secrecy under\#his now trademark hood rose to popularity seemingly out of\#nowhere."
"But just witnessing him giving one of his famous speeches\#to masses makes it very obvious why both the high and low\#class fell under his charms. Kaiser's energy is a sight to\#behold."
"In a short amount of time Kaiser has managed to unite the\#mid-western nations under the flag of Bremen."
"He formed the special troops 'The Marching Men of the Nights\#Day' which effectively have been expanding the Bremen reign at\#a rapid rate."
"A rate that has made the leaders of The Eastern Union worried.\#Where these turns take the world cannot be foreseen."
"His acts can very well be described as vile and monstrous,\#but only future history can tell if his means justify the\#ends."
"The Midnight Gazette, September 17, 1942\#The formation of 'The Marching Men of the Nights Day' marked\#the day Europa officially jumped the shark."
"There are conflicting stories as to whether the Bremen army\#has truly succumbed to the horrors the rumours speak of, but\#it is clear as a day, that something vile is brewing under\#that black and yellow banner of Kaiser's Bremen."
"Especially the campaigns that took place in the area of\#Bohemia. Kaiser pursued this area with such vigor, that it\#is without a question his endgame."
"It is hardly a coincidence that Kaiser is opening up the\#talks about the peace treaty right after his Bremen pig occupy\#Prehevil, the capital of Bohemia."
"The Kingdom of Rondon and the allied forces suspect that this\#whole Bremen ambition is directly linked to the advanced\#electronic network experiments the Eastern Union has been\#conducting in the area."
"It is beyond me how the masses fail to see through these\#plans. Instead they give credence to Kaiser's madness and\#place more trust in his perversions than logic."
"There are no rational answers to the irrational ideologies\#which Kaiser brings to the table. - An article written by\#Karin Sauer."

"Alll-mer - The ascended one. One of the two humanborn gods known\#to this day."
"There are two stories of the origins of Alll-mer."
"The more common story speaks of a human born from a virgin\#mother. A mere mortal that had humble origins, but one that quickly\#rose to prominence because of his teachings."
"Unlike the warring kings and sultans of the time, Alll-mer's ideal\#world united people of all different religions and ideologies under\#one umbrella."
"The powers of the time wouldn't stand up for this and quickly\#had him arrested and sentenced for a public humiliation and eventual\#death on a cross."
"This only served Alll-mer's purpose, making him a martyr and\#the pain he went through pushed him over the edge to his ascension\#to the true godhood."
"After his ascension, Alll-mer returned to avenge his death.\#The bloodbath that ensued shook the world order and demolished the\#worship New Gods of the time had been enjoying."
"The other version of Alll-mer's origins tells how Sylvian, the\#older god of fertility ordered a deity known as Vitruvia to create\#an architectural reprography of a man and a woman that would be\#to the likeness of Sylvian herself."
"Vitruvia, being the master architect, did just that. Sylvian fell\#in love with the results. She went on and created the mankind\#according to Vitruvia's drawings."
"At first Vitruvia was amazed by the life Sylvian managed to usher\#into her designs. However, over time Vitruvia started to see small\#imperfections here and there."
"Nothing bothered her more than the idea that her designs were\#anything but perfect."
"So she set out to create the perfect human being. The pinnacle of\#man's potential."
"This being was born on the year nil and he is the one known as\#Alll-mer today."
"On the surface level these stories don't contradict with\#themselves too much. But on an ideological level there are\#interesting differences."
"The other story tells how a mortal everyday man rose to rival\#the powers of older gods, while the other story makes Alll-mer\#just one more creation of the higher powers."
"The truth might lie somewhere between these stories if you'd\#ask me."
"The Mark of Alll-mer raises the physical protection of its wielder."
The text includes the sigil of the Alll-mer and instructions\#on how to use it.

"The only logical explanation I can come up with is that the people\#in this immediate area are under a mass psychosis of some kind."
"It's not too rare for such to occur in the times of continued war,\#like the times we live in. As an example for comparison, there was\#a mass psychosis brewing in the Empire of Bremen after the first\#great war as well."
"The VRIL society were stirring up public unrest among the working\#class. Their villainous front figures raved like a mad men and were\#able to enchant the vast majority of the country."

"The fourth blood and the final sacrifice - The girl who keeps\#me up at night. The songbird that utters her last whimpers."
"To finish the ritual, I need time. The laundry room works as a\#perfect hiding place for the sacrificed."
"I will swear on your name my lord, our one true leader, the Sulf--"\#The writing becomes too hard to read past this point.
"The seed of Gro'goroth that had been fermenting for an aeon,\#finally reached its maturity, and thus Sylvian pushed a whole\#pinecone out of her loose abyss and named her child Ninush."
"The cycle of destruction and creation is seen in its purest form\#in nature. Thus it comes as no surprise that the very god of nature,\#Vinushka is an offspring of the two older gods Gro-goroth and Sylvian."
"Like the nature of mankind, the nature of Vinushka too can change\#from fiery raging volcanos to serene grasslands where a gentle wind\#lulls one to sleep."
"The ancient tribes of men used to live in a symbiosis with the\#nature, with its cycles of destruction and creation."
"But people grew greedy and hostile towards the land they settled\#and ravaged the nature to give room for their own civilizations."
"As people grew greedy and hostile, so did Vinushka."
"A long war was waged to determine who was to become the master\#and who the slave. To everyone's surprise, or at least to my\#surprise, this resulted in the demise of Vinushka."
"For all tense and purposes the nature is dead. Vinushka died by\#the hands of men."
"From this grievous realization comes the name of the god. 'Vinushka'\#meaning guilt, the great guilt of mankind."
"This guilt will surely eat away the known world in time. For now\#faint traces of the god still linger in Vinushka's totems, deities\#that desperately search for the murdered god in vain."
"Maybe these totems are the manifestation of human guilt. Once they\#understand the events that took place, mankind will surely feel\#their grief too."
"For now it's best to exploit the nature while we still can.\#The Mark of Vinushka raises the otherwordly offence of its wielder."
The text includes the sigil of the Vinushka and instructions on how\#to use it.
"- The truth under the moonlight -"
"Who of us doesn't cover their true face and hide behind a persona?"
"In the broad daylight we adopt a social role depending on the\#surrounding people. We put on a mask that works as the public image\#of our true personality."
"Do we hide our face to avoid the judgement of the people, or do\#we look down in shame as the sun watches our every move?"
"A sun that knows our deepest longings and lustful thoughts."
"Only in the darkness of the night does the true and vile nature\#of men get revealed. We share our decrepit bodies only to the select\#few under the moonlight."
"Despite what lowly thieves, covering in the shadows, would like you\#to think, the moonlight hides no one."
"The similarities between the nature and mankind are fitting as\#both grew up sucking the many bosoms of Sylvian after all. Both\#were born from the same loins."
"Vinushka and the represenation of humanity, Alll-mer the Ascended\#One are considered equal. Neither of the two stands taller."
"What is Vinushka's, is for the men to reap, just as the nature\#reaps our old and weary."
"The Mark of Vinushka raises the otherwordly offence of its wielder."
"...Looking back at the history of this place - There has been\#settlement here for as long as the history books cover the area. It\#has always centered around the mysterious Hollow Tower that works as\#the central pillar of the community."
"The city flourished during the cruel age in the 1600s, but it\#quickly fell from prominence the closer we got to the modern times."
"I understand the city is medium in size as far as cities in\#eastern Europa go, but still I find it hard to believe that this\#place would serve as a hub of any kind in a civilized world."
"For some reason the goverment officials insist that Prehevil keeps\#its capital identity despite it being one of the more remote and\#unwelcoming cities in all of Bohemia, if not all of Europa."
"The only explanation I can come up with is that the country is proud\#of the old archaic rites that still go down in this city and they\#want to show their full support."
"If you were to visit Prehevil and sightsee its small center, you'd\#see glimpses of its ancient glory days, still well and alive in these\#modern times."
"Do not let the western style shopping district with its latest\#movie posters and advetisements fool you, the locals still worship\#the old world order in the dank and crumling parts of the town."
"Ritualistic murder sites are just around the corner no matter where\#you are in the city. While the churches look to be dedicated to our\#one true god Alll-mer from the outside, insides tell a whole different\#story."
"Ancient gods without name in any known language still linger in\#those crypts. And why wouldn't they? You can hear the priests chant\#their masses in the moonlit alleys during the dead of the night."
"The whole wicked city is a playground for the ancient beings and\#the people living there offer themselves to the first taker without\#second thought."
"The God of Fear and Hunger - There are popular texts that tell\#stories of a false god and a chosen human joining together in the\#darkest and the wettest of dreams."
"The forgotten and long dormant God of the Depths perished that\#night. Only an older god never truly perishes. In its stead, the\#God of Fear and Hunger planted its roots and started to grow her\#influence on the surface world."
"The scheming false deity had hoped her daughter would be the\#light of mankind. Only true darkness does not breed light."
"The god of Fear and Hunger was a pure child, a blank slate birthed\#in the darkest pits of human creation. That is where she grew, that\#is all she knew."
"She was the pure representation of fear and hunger, not spoiled by\#even a glimmer of hope."
"Mankind had seen its share of stagnation and suffering up to\#that point. To rise from those perilious pits, growing pains were\#necessary. Progress comes at a price."
"Fear motivated people while hunger kept them moving forward."
"People cherished their hardship and drew inspiration from it.\#They learned from it. What followed was advancement the mankind\#had not seen since the forgotten ages."
"The dark fumes that rise from the pipes of modern cities are\#direct consequences of this era. An era that came to be known\#as the Cruel Age."
"The Mark of Fear and Hunger raises the agility of its wielder."
The text includes the sigil of Fear and Hunger and instructions on\#how to use it.

"Furniture moving without a reason, flickering lights, a television\#set turning on, all on its own. These are usually the first signs\#of a shadow presence or a spirit trying to contact you from the\#otherside."
"There is no need to be scared about this. Spirits vary and there\#are as many types as there are personality types among the living.\#Some are kind, some are hostile."
"You can confirm a spirit presence using the talking board.\#Asking a simple opening question like 'Is anyone out there?' or\#'Can you hear me?' opens up a connection between you two."
"If a spirit wants to communicate with you, you will get a\#very clear physical confirmation of this with the planchette\#(the heart-shaped indicator) moving on its own."
"Spirits can only manifest before you when you are close enough\#to them. If a spirit is willing, it can lead you to it using the\#talking board as its means of communication."

"Words about the death of an older god especially are nothing short\#of absurd."
"How do you kill an idea, an inspiration or one of the primordial\#concepts once it is conceived? The thought will forever haunt your\#mind as long as our consciousness is there to remind us of it."
"Once an older god is born, it has existed forever. A god, like\#a human soul is not constrained by linear time and space. It can\#reincarnate multiple times within our history and future history\#without us knowing any better."
"They spawn from the green stream, but which spawns first, an\#older god in its physical form or the concept our consciousness\#gave birth to?"
"The mockery that is 'the new gods', the puppets yearning to\#become the puppeteers, should never be mistaken with the gods that\#dwell beyond our understanding."
"They are but byproducts of the immense influence the older gods\#hold on us. Just by flying too close to the sun, or why not moon, and\#one can attain a glimpse of the true intensity that is older gods."

"- The Tale of the Pocketcat - Chapter 1 -"
"It was a rainy day in the countryside just north from the forest\#of Merwood."
"Willem, the most mischievous child known in the town, stared at\#the rain drops behind his window screen, just longing for an adventure."
"His mother would warn him of going outside. Rain brings forth all\#kinds of dangers not otherwise known to little boys. During downpours\#decent boys should help their parents with various household chores\#instead."
"Being the pompous boy he was, Willem refused to give a helping\#hand. The consequences of such refusals were all too familiar to\#Willem. He'd get sentenced to bed without a dinner. And so he did."
"Crying under his blanket, fits of Willem's anger brought forth his\#reflection from a mirror on the wall."
"The boy from the mirror introduced himself as Melliw, the sleeping\#twin brother of Willem that came to this world far too early and\#thus he could only view the world from the land of opposites."
"Melliw wanted to warn his brother of the coming calamity, but\#his words echoed from the land of opposites and so they came out\#all wrong."
"Now his words encouraged Willem to join the coming adventure that\#was heading his way, heading fast, in fact the adventure already\#squeezed itself through a small key hole on the window frame."
"A large beetleman climbed in from the window. The beetleman was\#tall, taller than Willem's father, and rounder than his father as\#well."
"The face of the beetleman was obscured. He wore a similar mask\#Willem's grandfather had worn in the war to avoid gas from melting\#his eyes and burning his lungs."
"Turkilo, the beetleman had an urgent mission for Willem. You see\#the ancient kingdom Turkilo came from was under a serious threat\#and Willem was the only boy who could help."
"Willem was a bit hesitant, but Turkilo was already forcing the\#boy out from his bedroom window out to the rain. 'We got no time\#for thinkin' said Turkilo."
"The beetleman showed the way with his lantern, only Willem had\#trouble keeping up with the pace as Turkilo flew fast deep inside\#the Merwood with his man-beetle wings."
"Turkilo's lantern got more distant until Willem couldn't see it\#no more."
"Hopeless, and now lost in the woods he started crying, not unlike\#how small song thrush chicks cry and beg for their mother for food."
"And just like that a giant song thrush grabbed Willem and took\#him to a treetop nest full of chicks fighting for their place in\#the world."
"Willem tried to beg for a tasty worm from the bird mother, but\#competition was fierce. Those chicks knew that to succeed in life\#you have to push the competition over nest boundaries."
"Willem tried to struggle but ultimately fell off the nest. Just\#as he was about to meet his maker Turkilo scooped by him and grabbed\#Willem with his cold man-beetle arms."
"- The Tale of the Pocketcat - Chapter 2 -"
"Turkilo scolded Willem from wandering off. When Willem tried to\#explain what had happened, that only aggravated the beetle man\#even more."
"To teach Willem a lesson, Turkilo kept pushing Willem deeper to\#the forest with his freakish man-beetle strength."
"Willem slid down a muddy hill and found himself on large opening\#in the forest. In the middle of that opening two giant babyfaced\#blindworms were caught in a wrestling match."
"The two poor bastards fought each other with all they got. The\#bit each other, clawed each other, all while crying and wallowing\#loudly."
"Turkilo yelled from above that this is the nature of men, that\#just like those song thrush chicks from earlier, this would be\#Willem's future once he grew up to become an adult."
"Humans were ruthless in their pursuit for riches and wealth. Did\#Willem really want to take part in such fierce competition?"
"While the two talked, the other, the more ugly faced blindworm\#had bested the other. Hungry for more devastation the thing set\#its eyes on Willem."
"It gave Willem a desperate chase. Turkilo just flew away cackling\#'This is what you wanted, right?'"
"Willem ran to a nearby thicket in hopes that the blindworm couldn't\#fit in there, instead the beast thrusted itself past broken branches\#with ferocious force."
"Fat from eating his other babyfaced blindworm sibling, one\#particularly sharp branch punctured the belly of the beast and\#from within hundreds of small blindworm babies spilled all over\#the place."
"The little worms started wrestling and devouring each other the\#moment they landed on the ground. Willem realized this is how the\#giant babyfaced blindworms got so big to begin with."
"They kept eating each other until only one remained."
"For now it seemed like Willem was safe. It was not yet his turn\#to devour or be devoured. For some reason he did not feel comfortable\#though. It felt like someone or something was keenly watching his\#every move."
"He heard faint panting and rustling of leaves. Then he noticed\#them, a pair of glowing eyes staring right at him from the darkness\#of shrubs and leaves."
"Willem did not like how the stare felt, panicked and ran to the\#opposite direction."
"Little did Willem know at the time, but what followed his every\#move from behind the bush was the tall cat, the Pocketcat himse--"

The person looks to have a rather normal female body. A little bit\#more muscular than usual perhaps, but nothing out of ordinary.
She has sewn her mouth partly shut and there appears to be more\#sewn cuts scattered around her body. Their purpose is unknown to\#you, but they do distort her face beyond recognition.
But despite that... She eerily reminds you of someone...
The more you entertain the idea, the more certain you become of\#this haunting realization.
No matter how disfigured her face would be, you would always\#recognize your wife Elise... This woman has her appearance. You\#are 100% certain of this now.
But it's impossible. She is dead...
Either you are losing your mind slowly but surely, this place has\#finally gotten the best of you... Or maybe there is some other\#sinister reasoning behind all this...
You hope that it is only your mind that is crumbling here...\#You wish Elise has her rest now...
Because of the sewn cuts, the body is especially weak against\#slashing attacks that might open the cuts. Also blunt attacks\#might open the stitches.
