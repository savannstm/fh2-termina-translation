\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"The boys are training. Something at the city really shook Tanaka\#up. He insisted that Marcoh would show him some moves."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Apparently Marcoh is an amateur boxer! I mean he does look the\#part, but... I thought he felt more gentle. Roughing up people in\#a ring sounds pretty violent."
"You can fight people without ill will too."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Yeah, I guess so."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"No denying that."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Oh? Sure I guess!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Now that I can move around more freely, it would be good to see\#just what is happening here..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Then again, your party seem pretty sizable already. Wouldn't we\#just draw more attention if I tagged along?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I think it's better for me to stay here for a while longer."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Hi! I heard you met Marcoh in the city!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"We were thinking whether it makes any sense to stay at the train\#any longer..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"If any help was to come, I'm sure it would be here already."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"And when the city itself is in the shape it is..."

Olivia is down...
You get the \c[2]Alchemillia vol.1\c[0], \c[2]Mix of red and blue\c[0] herbs and\#a \c[2]Green herb\c[0].

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"I couldn't help but notice your accent, you are from the old\#country of Oldegård, aren't you?"
"That's right."
"I'm surprised you recognize the accent."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"It always gives me such a warm feeling to hear the accent of\#the good and honest people of the north."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"Oh I certainly do. The language has a special place in my heart."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"You see my family roots come from Oldegård as well. My\#grandfather used to talk to me in his mother tongue when I was\#just a small child."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"I'm one quarter Oldegårdian that is. I can understand the language\#perfectly well, although my speech might not be quite as fluent\#I'm afraid."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"During my younger years, I visited the country a dozen times, but\#it has been way too long since my last trip there."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"The green valleys, the endless forests and the thousand lakes\#call me."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"Maybe after my current business trip I will finally settle down\#there and enjoy the long snowy winters and the bright summer nights\#when the sun never sets."
"You're making me homesick as well."
"Where are you from then, if not from Oldegård?"
"I thought there was something familiar about your looks!"
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"Ha ha, it must be in our genes then. The northern wind summons\#us no matter where we travel."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"I've lived a full nomad life all my time. Travelling from one\#country to another."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"It is almost like a family tradition at this point. We have always\#been on the road for generations."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"But I wanted that tradition to stop at me. My two children live\#with their mother in Valland. I do not consider it my home country\#per se, but I suppose that is the closest to one I got."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"In any case, I do want my children to have some sense of stability.\#Maybe it's time I take them see their roots to Oldegård."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"Oh you humble me with your words. To say such a thing is the\#highest compliment you could give me."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"Nice day isn't it?"
"A bit foggy."
"If you say so..."
"What brings you here?"
"Good bye."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"True enough."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"But it is peaceful in its own right, don't you think?"
"I agree."
"I find it eerie."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\#"Do no fret. I'm sure if you stay at the train it'll be alright."

No reaction. He seems to be dead.
You find nothing...
You get 6 \c[2]Silver shillings\c[0], a \c[2]Bear trap\c[0] and a \c[2]Suede jacket\c[0].

Looks like he died because of his injuries...
A suitcase is left here without supervision.
Anyone could steal it!
Nothing interesting in the news paper...
The door to the previous cabin is locked from the other side.
Looking through the window, the cabin seems pitch black...
You can see a misty forest from the tainted window.
The man seems to be sleeping heavily...
"Excuse me..."
Leave him be
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\#*Snore* *Snore*
No reaction. Still deep in a sleep.
"Wake up!"
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\#"..."
No reaction.
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Cocaine... Wine... Hookers..."\c[0]
He appears to be dreaming and that's why you can't get a clear\#image of his thoughts.
These seats are perfectly suited for resting. You just need to\#clear out all the papers out of the way first...
You find a \c[2]Combat manual\c[0] and \c[2]Prehevil map\c[0]!
The seats here look wide enough for you to take a rest...
But you should probably check your surroundings first.
You recognize this man!
He is Caligura, also known as the "Count Dragul". One of the\#caporegime, or captains, from a rival branch in The Family.
You have no idea what he is doing here though.
Could he be on to you?
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"The fuck do you want?"
"What's your problem?"
The man just keeps looking directly at you without saying a word...
You are not sure whether he recognize you or not...
He doesn't say a word, but you can see his expression getting angrier...
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"The fuck is this!?"
You absorbed the \c[2]Decrepit soul\c[0].
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\#"The fuck do you want?"
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\#"The fuck is this!?"

You read his mind...\#\c[1]"This one pisses me off. It's not enough that I got stuck here\#with these bastards in the middle of nowhere?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Now they are even trying to strike small talk with me!?"\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"..."
"A weird situation we're in, right?"
His expression just keeps getting more grim...
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"I know I've seen him before... But where?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Don't tell me he's someone from The Family...? Or the cops?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"I swear... One more word from this asshat..."\c[0]
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\#"That fucking does it."
These seats are perfectly suited for resting. You just need to\#clear out all the books and papers out of the way first...
Something draws you towards these seats...
These seats are perfectly suited for resting if only this\#mystery man didn't stand right next to it...
Someone has left a book here...
You should probably check your surroundings first.
The man in the suit is talking to himself.
He seems to be completely lost in his own thoughts...
\>\i[81]\}ALARYMAN\{\<\#"I'm late already, so late..."
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"How am I going to explain this? This trip was a bad idea from the\#start."\c[0]
The ropes... They are loose now for no apparent reason.
You are free.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"The sleepy one."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"My story? You gotta be more specific. I'm too complicated for just\#a few lines of dialogue."
"Are you going to stay and wait here?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"It's my hometown. I'm originally from Prehevil."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"But I'd never admit it in a conversation that I was from such\#a depressing and godforsaken small town."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"So you'll only make yourself look stupid if you go spreading the\#word."
"It's my hometown as well."
"Where are you returning from?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Cool! Let's just both keep quiet about it. We don't want to look\#like banjo-playing yokels in this crowd."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"From studies..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I've been studying occultism for about 6 years in the Vatican City."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"It's a big shock coming back to a town of this size."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Feeling like slitting my wrists right about now. I'm not exactly\#a fan of the Prehevilian melancholy."
"I thought Prehevil was a medium-sized city."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Even medium-sized cities can be uncivilized, believe me."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Probably not. I'll be heading towards the town soon if nothing\#happens here."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Oh yeah... It was cool."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"There is something bothering me though... No one talked much\#about the moon. That rapist-smile will leave a scar in my\#sub-consciousness for sure."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Maybe it's just because I've been studying this stuff for the\#majority of my life, but I think it was a vision, meant for us\#to decipher."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Just seems obvious, you know."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"That's why I have hard time believing the conspiracy stuff the\#other guys were talking about."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Just felt a little artistic..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Actually I hate drawing. I'm really bad at it."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Luckily ritual circles don't require the same skills."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Honestly I just had an ominous feeling about all this.\. Maybe\#this little carving will have some use..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Here, you can loan this. Once the circle is done, you might find\#some use for it too."
You get \c[2]Skin bible - God of Fear and Hunger\c[0]!
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Just give me the book back later, okay?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"H-hey what do you think you're doing!?"

"Hallucinogens?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"It's not exactly public knowledge, but a year ago I was investigating\#a scoop that involved the Allied countries..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"The Kingdom of Rondon and Valland had their highest army officials\#gathered on a remote island hundreds of kilometers from the coastline\#in the Bleu Sea."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"They had a new kind of experimental weapon ready for war. It was\#'a plutonium-based implosion-type device'."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"A ridiculously big bomb in other words. One that created a crater\#over 300 metres wide."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Obviously the thing totally demolished the island it was used on,\#but what made the bomb even more terrifying and vile was that the\#plutonium used in the bomb left the area radiated."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"The wildlife near the island suffered greatly from the nuclear\#radiation. Many of the animals had similar-ish symptoms you see here\#in people."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Radiation poisoning and burns, the most drastic effects were\#mutations. Sounds familiar, right?"
"You think a similar bomb was detonated here?"
"Science can't explain the things happening here."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"No, no, not at all. This place would be far more wrecked if that\#was the case."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I'm just thinking that Bremen and Eastern Union must be aware of\#the weapon the Allied countries have at their disposal."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Whatever is happening here, could be an alternative to that."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Somekind of a new weapon Bremen snuck from the Eastern Union\#when they occupied this area."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Why else see all the effort getting to this small town in the\#middle of nowhere?"
"Why wasn't the Allied weapon ever used in war?"
"Any theories what it could be?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"You don't need to shoot your gun when robbing a bank. It's enough\#if you just point the thing."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"You must have noticed that neither Bremen nor Eastern Union tried\#to expand their borders towards west for a good while now."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I don't have all the puzzle pieces yet... There is something more\#to this. Something that causes all the dreams and drives people to\#madness..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Oh you're one of those people..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Sure, go ahead and believe in your old gods. I just don't think\#we have enough common ground to continue this discussion."

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"They are not coming to help you if that's what you're thinking."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"They'll get what is just and deserved."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"What's in the past, is in the past..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"We can't get our wrongdoings undone. But you can try to explain...\#Why did you do it?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"That doesn't fly in the court."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Start thinking better motives."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"That doesn't exactly fly in the court."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"But that's the thing, you've proven yourself to be a true wildcard.\#There's no way we could trust you anymore."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Better start thinking some good motives."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I hear the jails are on the nasty side around here."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"We can treat you like a human being until we give you to police,\#or we can treat you like a cold blooded murderer."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"By staying quiet, you're not exactly gaining any sympathy."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I think we're done here."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Sheesh... I guess I have to do this, since no one else is up\#for it."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"So..."
He is looking at you intensely, thinking what to say...
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Why?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Why attack someone like that?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"You mean the moon from the nightmare?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Let me get this straight - In a dream someone, not even 'someone',\#but a frickin' moon god told you to kill, and that's why you did\#what you did?"
"That is how the festival works!"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I see, I see..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"And you took a head start and started killing us just like that?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"That's the gist of it then?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I'm not good at this kind of stuff..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"But if I do cut you free, you're not going to do anything to\#me?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"We are having some trust issues here, I hope you understand that."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"We didn't do anything. That one got away."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I have to admit it's a bit troublesome..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"We didn't do anything. They ran away."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Why did you do it though?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Right, right..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"But I mean you could try at least?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Oh well..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I can't just do that. We are having some trust issues here, I\#hope you understand that."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"You're not going to talk, huh?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Once we make it out of here, we'll be giving you to the Bohemian\#police, or army, or whoever is the first to offer their services."
Someone just came from the next cabin...
"Wait up!"
"You have to help me!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Hi... How are you doing?"
"I'm fine."
"Cut me free or I'll kill you!"
"I'm starving!"
"I'm so sorry..."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You don't want to talk. I understand."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"So how about it? This is all we got at the moment."
She is offering you a loaf of bread.
"Thank you."
"I don't need your pity."
Just eat it
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You're welcome."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Oh... Well..."

\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Ah... Yes... You've been here for a while."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Regret itself is not good, but if it's used to reflect oneself,\#then it can lead to growth."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"And that's good. It's the first step towards redemption."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"I'm not in a mood for a talk either."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"We thought we need to keep you alive until the police come.\#So you will need some food, right?"
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"It might still take a while before we get out. So this is all\#we got for now."
He is offering you a loaf of bread.
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"But you do need food. Are you sure you don't want this?"

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Cold blood..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Maybe I was mistaken? Maybe you're not that hungry?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Good. If it was up to me, you'd be starving even longer."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"But alas, the others are more compassionate than me."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Save your tears for the cops."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I just came to give you something to eat. Because it's the human\#thing to do. Something you should learn more about."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Nothing?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Good. I didn't want to hear your rubbish anyway."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"In any case, it's your lucky day. I got this moldy bread loaf\#for you."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Yep, what you need is a good whoopin', but I'll leave that to\#the Bohemian law enforcers."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"But since you're not hungry..."
Marcoh eats the bread loaf in front of you. He seems to be savouring\#the bread for as long as possible.
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"A bit dry, but serves its purpose."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Well I'm off. Have a good day."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Hi..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You probably noticed that we are still stuck here."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"The thing is... There is something weird going on in this place..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"It's hard to describe. The local people... Something has happened\#to them. They've gone crazy."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I... I don't really know what to do. Most of the people went for\#the city, but they never returned."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I fear something bad has happened to them..."
"What do you mean that there is something wrong with the locals?"
"How many are there still left at the train?"
"I fail to see how any of this is my problem?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You'd have to see it to believe. They've changed. They look...\#They look sick... And malformed..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"It's unlike anything I've ever seen. Even the worst gothic novels\#pale in comparison."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Ah... That's... It's better if I don't tell you too much."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"That's what I was told anyway. I hope you understand."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Uh... Well when you put it that way..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"The reason why I'm telling you all this..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I think I need to leave the train too. We just can't stay here\#any longer."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"But I'll send help here the moment we meet someone."
"You can't just leave me behind!"
"You open these ropes now or I'll kill you!"
"B-but how can I survive here on my own?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"We discussed about this..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I don't like it, but... You are an liability."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"But don't worry! We'll send someone here later!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I promise!"

You get a \c[2]Rifle .303 Mk I\c[0], 5 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0] and an \c[2]Army jumpsuit\c[0].
You took \c[2]Levi's head\c[0] as a trophy!

Just hearing the words 'ninth circle' sends a shiver down your\#spine. You've heard rumours of the place.
The Vatican City has desperately been trying to reach the older\#gods for hundereds of years, all without luck.
Supposedly a select group of children who were considered naturally\#gifted at channeling the otherworldly were locked at the ninth circle\#where their bodies would wither in an ancient rite to receive any\#messages from the older gods. All without luck.
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"So... I didn't study with you. It wasn't like that."
"Ninth circle is real?"

\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"That's what he wants. That's what the moon wants too."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"Do you have what it takes?"
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"Maybe."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"The festival doesn't happen by chance."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"The moon god chose this area on purpose."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"If you found out what that 'purpose' is..."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"Good for you."
"Are you nervous about the third day?"
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"No. Not really."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"They teach us at the Vatican City there's very little we humans\#can do once the gods decide to act."
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\#"Why stress something you have no input on?"
Pav is down...
You get an \c[2]Army uniform\c[0], a \c[2]Lugr pistol\c[0] and 10 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0].
You took \c[2]Pav's head\c[0] as a trophy!
These seats are perfectly suited for resting...
\>\i[81]\}ALARYMAN\{\<\#"Oh--"
\>\i[81]\}ALARYMAN\{\<\#"It's you. From the train..."
\>\i[81]\}ALARYMAN\{\<\#"Keep quiet... There is something going on here. I have a bad\#feeling about this..."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Oh--"
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Keep quiet... There is something going on here. I have a bad\#feeling about this..."
The well seems dark and deep. You get an urge to jump down...
Jump down
As your eyes adjust to the darkness, the well doesn't look that deep\#after all...
You can see the bottom of pretty easily. The well has dried up.
There is a well here...
Climb down
The barrels appear empty.
You can see the bottom of the well pretty well. The well has dried\#up.
\>\i[81]\}ALARYMAN\{\<\#"... Do you hear something...? From ahead?"
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"... Do you hear something...? From ahead?"
You pick up \c[2]Wild dagga\c[0].
Black Kalev is eating...
Give him a \c[2]Carrot\c[0]
"I guess we all could use a small break."
"We need to get going now."
"Enough with the munching!"
Black Kalev takes the carrot nonchalantly and returns to\#your party.
\>\i[65]\}LACK KALEV\{\<\#"..."
Black Kalev gives you absolutely no attention at all.
Black Kalev disagrees with you.
In a spur of rebellion Black Kalev started munching on the\#grass with even more vigor.
It seems to mock you.
Seems like Black Kalev was waiting for you already...
"Are you ready to continue?"
"Just wait here a little while longer."
Black Kalev joins back your party.
You search through the leaves...
Something tells you that there might be something hidden here...
You find a \c[2]Smelter key\c[0]!
The lone goat came to greet you. The goat seems to be following\#your every move attentively.
"Want to join my party?"
"I can't take you as a burden."
The goat is shaking its horns in agreement.
The goat is shaking its horns in disagreement.
It's not willing to take no for an answer it seems.
The goat joins your party.
The body is badly mutilated...
The body has nothing of value.
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\#"TERMINA IS UPON US!"
Suddenly Black Kalev stops on its hooves...
GabText You hear something from ahead...
There's a lone goat here. It seems to be minding its own\#business, completely ignoring your presence.
Give it a \c[2]Carrot\c[0]!
Pet it
The goat eats the carrot without any festivities.
It still doesn't acknowledge your existence in the slightest.
You pet its head. Absolutely no reaction. Its glassy eyes\#stare right through you.
It almost feels like the goat thinks so highly of itself that\#it doesn't need to acknowledge you.
The goat stares to the distance with its glassy eyes. On the\#first glance the creature seems harmless, but upon further\#investigating it, you are met with feelings of great dread.
You can't really explain why this is...
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"This one is creepy. Really weird."
The lone goat greets you. The goat seems to be following\#your every move attentively.
Unfortunately you do not have rooms for one more goat in your\#party.
You pick up a \c[2]Fly amanita\c[0].
A badly mutilated head of a villager...
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\#"Leave now stranger."
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\#"LEAVE."
"What is happening here?"
"Did you kill that man?"
"You were the one who helped me?"
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\#"LEAVE! Or die..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Let's see what we can find here..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Green herbs often grow in open areas. These cliffs and rocky hills\#should be optimal for them."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"If we look behind every nook and cranny, we should find more of\#them..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Let's check this house out. There has to be someone sane left in\#this godforsaken little town..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Everyone's gone crazy here, haven't they?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"No matter how many houses we check. No one with a right mind around."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"The old town is just north of here... Let's head towards the city\#center."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Should go knocking on the door? There could be someone who could\#help us?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"The house looks charming enough..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"The silence of these woods... Does it soothe and calm you?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Because it surely doesn't do that to me! It's creepy!"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"What are the chances that there would be someone nice and normal\#waiting for us inside?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Yeah, we'd be better off playing lottery."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Maybe we could take a small break inside?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I should've packed my hiking boots with me... I'm getting blisters\#from all this walking."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"The house could work as a decent vantage point..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"I can smell the old town from here. What a foul smell that place\#has."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I wouldn't mind growing old in a house like this..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Sitting on the porch in the evening... Maybe sharing that with\#someone..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Erm, nevermind."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"We got more pressing matters."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Is it normal to have this much fog around these parts?"
Only a \c[2]Fly amanita\c[0] here.
A bloody ritual crucifix. They used to have these in the olden\#times, but you've never seen one in person.
The smell and sight of the sacrificed corpses is repulsive!\#You feel like throwing up.
GabText You hear distant screams and ramblings... You are not alone.
GabText The trenchgun destroys the lock!
GabText The death mask is shot down!
GabText You shoot the arm of the death mask!
GabText The death mask is hurt!
The doorway is boarded up from outside. Is it to keep something\#in?
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The tall monster of a man seems to have rash all over its body.\#The rash seems to focus on the neck area and possibly to face\#and head, but that is impossible to tell because of the mask."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The mask itself has melted on the patient's face and formed\#a light layer of exoskeleton-like crust that continues from\#the mask to the neck."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Despite somewhat large frame, the man seems to be weak against\#piercing attacks as well as otherwordly powers."

An empty barrel left here to gather rain water.
The gate is locked firmly with two different padlocks...
You seem to have both of the required keys. Remove the chains?
The other padlock has a carving of an eagle and the other has\#a carving of a two-tailed lion.
Force the gate open
Remove chains?
You can only see dusty interior inside. It doesn't seem like\#a place that has seen much life and excitement recently...
No reaction. He must be dead. But for how long?
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I'm confused. I can still feel a pulse from this thing."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"All the wounds and beating this guy took would suggest that he's\#good as dead, but no..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I don't know. Don't ask me these hard questions."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Even I don't have all the answers."
The person seems to still be alive. At least you can still feel\#his pulse.
This goes against everything you know and understand. The wounds\#on his body should be lethal but something is keeping him alive.
You do not have answers for this.
You took the \c[2]Death mask head\c[0] as a trophy!
It looks like someone is standing still in the darkness...
You pick up a \c[2]Red herb\c[0].
You don't see anything besides darkness inside...

\>\i[65]\}EGGAR\{\<\#"An' here I thought the war was 'ready coming to an end."

You hear voices echoing from him...\#\c[1]"One sheep, two sheeps, three sheeps - all for the slaughter."\c[0]
The door is locked...
The sign says "Closed until tomorrow."
The door won't open. It seems to be locked from the other side.

There are pigs standing in the pen. They look well-fed.

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"This is barbaric! What kind of religion would have rituals like\#this!?"

\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"They used to have crosses like these in all villages and towns\#across Europa still 200 years ago."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"Usually a village would sacrifice anywhere from one to ten people\#on a cross every year to appease Alll-mer and ask for protection\#against otherwordly powers."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#Like I said, the rite started to die out a couple hundred years\#ago, but some places obviously still kept the ritual."

Nosophobia
Skip The Character History?
The soothing sound of the railtracks... You are not used to such\#peaceful and tranquil atmosphere.
You can't help but let your mind wander. You reminisce what has\#lead you to this point in life...
Prehevil. It's your hometown, even if it has a tainted past\#painted all around its narrow alleyways.
The painful memories would start from that one night...
Your parents were arguing downstairs. The argument would heat up,\#like always, and it would turn into a fight.
Your mother charged inside your room in desperation. She locked\#the door and pushed it with all her might.
First the odor of old vodka carried over to your room, then you\#heard your father's heavy steps walk up the stairs.
Your father started bashing down the door.
Pray for a god
Stand up against your father
Which god?
Gro-goroth
Sylvian
Alll-mer
The moon god
Vinushna
The god of fear & hunger
The gods didn't answer to your prayers this time, but you made\#a pact with the said god for life.
Your efforts didn't matter much before the drunken stupor of\#your father. It did raise your maximum bodily resilience though.
With your mother gone and your father drinking in the gutter, you\#were taken to the Prehevil orphanage.
The place treated children awfully and all kinds of rumours\#circulated on why kids would disappear occasionally without a trace.
You couldn't wait to get out of there as soon as possible. Unfortunately\#your wishes were answered sooner than you could've guessed.
When the second great war started, the Eastern Union recruited\#every able-bodied person no matter the age to fight for the\#motherland.
You were only 13 at the time, but still they dragged you with\#them. What kind of weaponry did you specialize in?
Pistols
Rifles
Trenchguns
You got \c[2]Lugr Pistol\c[0] and 10 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]!
You got \c[2]Rifle .303 Mk I\c[0] and 4 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0]!
You got \c[2]12-gauge Trenchgun\c[0] and 3 \c[2]12-gauge shells\c[0]!
You excelled on the battlefield despite your age. However you\#grew bitter as you saw younger and younger kids being recruited\#and killed as the war dragged on.
By this time you were already responsible for your own squad of\#child soldiers. You were given a mission meant for expendables,\#one that would be a guaranteed suicide mission.
You were already growing tired of the haphazard way of distributing\#troops and the general morale of the Eastern Union army was starting\#to show its cracks...
Take the mission and fulfil your duty
Abandon the sinking ship
You survived the mission despite impossible odds. This increased\#your proficiency in your branch of weaponry.
You learn \c[2]Gunslinger\c[0]!
You learn \c[2]Marksmanship\c[0]!
You learn \c[2]Executioner\c[0]!
Unfortunately the mission had its toll on you as well. Your psyche\#couldn't handle all the losses on the battlefield. So you had to\#take opioids to ease the pain. You formed an addiction.
You got \c[2]Heroin\c[0] and withdrawal symptoms!
You couldn't stand up for this any longer and became a deserter.\#The Eastern Union wouldn't forgive such crimes, so you had to pack\#up wisely for your escape...
Stock up on medical goods
Stock up on ammo
Stock up on food
You managed to find 2 \c[2]Blue vials\c[0] and a \c[2]Cloth fragment\c[0]!
You managed to find 3 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0]!
You managed to find 2 \c[2]12-gauge shells\c[0]!
You managed to find 4 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]!
You managed to find 2 \c[2]Dried meats\c[0] and a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0]!
How long has it been? Feels like a lifetime since you left the\#town...
It's not a place anyone would want to return to, but when you got no\#other place in this world, you are left with no options...
Save your character history?
Skip the intro?
You feel like someone was watching you while you slept...
You were born into the church of Alll-mer. For many generations\#your lineage took part in the most wicked of rituals only to\#appease gods of a forgotten age.
A life of a dark priest is a cruel one even if modern times\#overlooked the most archaic and ancient rites. A dark priest's life\#begins and ends in full dedication to the older gods. There is\#no place for self in the church.
You mother had different plans for you. She didn't want you to\#go down the path that would befall to every firstborn son in church.
So when she finally let your father know of your birth, she told\#him a daughter was born to the household.
You were dressed accordingly. Your distant and often absent father\#didn't get a wind of the original nature of things, or he just\#denied what was in front of his face. In either case, the subject\#was never brought up.
As you grew a little bit older, you didn't question this either.\#Everything felt natural this way, so who cares?
You grew up at the churchyard in the city of Prehevil. You started\#your religious studies at a fairly young age.
You were given an option to choose which studies you would pursue -\#Something completely unheard of if you had been a firstborn son of\#a dark priest.
Study occultism
Study alchemy
Study blood magic
You learn \c[2]Engrave\c[0]!
You got the books \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1 and vol. 2\c[0]!
You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0]!
You proved out to have great talent as an occultist and slowly\#even the holy city of Vatican and their Ministry of Darkness heard\#about your feats.
You were offered a scholarship at the Vatican City to further\#educate yourself. You took the position without hesitation.
Just the idea of getting away from your condescending and stuck\#up father was enough to make the decision, not to mention the\#obvious benefits the Vatican City would have to offer. Your home\#town wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis.
Your mother was very proud of you. She always was. Your father\#on the other hand seemed jealous of you.
Your father had always been antagonistic towards you and your\#pursuits. You were not sure if it had something to do with your\#origin or if there was something else left unsaid...
At the Ministry of Darkness, Vatican City - In the initiation\#ceremony all the new student would have to choose an older god\#that they'd let inside them.
Who did you choose?
Vinushka
You affliction with the said god grew greatly.
Everything was going well with your studies until one day you\#got a letter from home. It was written by your father. This was\#very strange. You didn't have any contact with him since your\#departure.
The letter told that your mother had passed away. The words were\#cold and without sympathy.
You tried calling your home but the telephone exchange couldn't\#connect to any phone in the Prehevilian area.
You had a suspicion that your father had something to do with\#this. He had always been too obsessed with the blood magic and\#you had learned that there were too many rites that demanded the\#blood of your loved ones to work.
There was no other way. You had to prepare for a trip back home,\#to Prehevil.
How did you prepare for the travels?
Get something to read
You get \c[2]Skin bible - Gro-goroth\c[0]!
You get \c[2]Skin bible - Rher\c[0]!
You get \c[2]Skin bible - Vinushka\c[0]!
Since you were a toddler, you had been travelling around the\#Europa with your parents.
Your parents were devout followers of the older god of fertility\#and creation, Sylvian.
Because of the nature of Sylvian's cult, in each new town you'd\#witness your parents putting on their rabbit masks and heading to\#the meadows naked with all the other cult members.
You hated this life. Your parents would be more concerned on the\#matters of religion than you. To make it worse, they even tried\#to pass on the healing gift of Sylvian to you.
From very early on you learned that no gift comes without a price.\#With Sylvian's "gift of healing" you saw how the mental state of\#your parents deteriorated over time.
They spent longer and longer times on the meadows. Until one day\#they never returned...
You were 13 years of age and alone in the Kingdom of Rondon. You\#had to do something for living...
Try to find honest work
Try to become a pickpocket
A butler of a local aristocrat took you under his wing as an\#apprentice. You started working for the Baron Eihner Von Dutch.
You learned good manners, grew to appreciate fine arts and other\#perks that high class living brought along.
Over time you got better acquainted with the daughter of the\#house. Her name was Elise. She would be endlessly amused by your\#childhood stories and all the madness your past cult life brought\#with it.
The baron himself learned of you upbringing as well and was\#fascinated by Sylvian and her healing properties.
The baron used to work as a doctor and he had very different concepts\#for healing and mending wounds.
He taught you about the modern medical practices in exchange for\#your knowledge on the older god Sylvian. To be honest, his thirst\#for otherwordly knowledge felt a little bit obsessive even.
He taught you how you cannot cure any symptoms without giving\#something in return. To heal, something of equal value must be\#lost.
Memorize this very line
Continue with the studies to learn more
You learned \c[2]Medicinal\c[0] and the mandatory skill of \c[2]Organ\#Harvest\c[0] that comes along with it.
You learned \c[2]Analyze\c[0]!
The most important thing learned is that you trade your life,\#your self in the practice of medicine. That is the price to save\#lives of the others.
You didn't have any natural talent as a pickpocket per se and\#the underworld of Rondon was very rough on you...
You weren't cut out to be a street thug, so you had to rely on the\#only skills you had for the money... The healing gift of Sylvian.
You ended up starting a street praction of medical care where\#you'd heal people of all social classes.
You soon became surprisingly adept with the healing gift of\#Sylvian.
You learned \c[2]Loving whispers\c[0] and your affinity with\#Sylvian grew!
One day the local doctor and aristocrat, Baron Eihner Von Dutch\#came to your dirty office out of curiosity.
He wasn't familiar with the Sylvian's teachings. The modern medical\#care worked with very different concepts and methods where magic\#certainly wasn't included in the curriculum.
Nevertheless, the baron was fascinated by your otherwordly means\#of healing and was impressed by the results.
He made a proposition to you that you simply couldn't turn down.\#He offered to take you in as his apprentice and in return he only\#asked to learn more about Sylvian and other older gods.
You agreed and moved in to his huge manor. The first one to welcome\#you was the daughter of the baron, Elise Von Dutch. Something\#inside you changed that very moment as the two of you locked eyes.
As time went on, you became an item with Elise. Everything fell\#into place very naturally and even the baron gave you his blessing\#despite your background being anything but noble.
For the first time in your life, everything felt just right. But\#this wouldn't last for long as something terrible had been brewing\#in the Eastern Europa for a good while.
The conflict between the Eastern Union and the Bremen Empire had\#dragged many neighbouring countries to take part in the hostilities\#and the Kingdom of Rondon was no exception.
The kingdom was enlisting all able-bodied men to the frontlines\#and you had no choice but to pack your bags and join the Great War.
Because of your knowledge in medicine, you were given an option\#to join the army as a medic or pick up a gun and join as an\#infantry trooper.
Join as a medic
Join the infantry
You were given a \c[2]Scalpel\c[0], a \c[2]Light blue vial\c[0]\#and \c[2]Pep pills\c[0]!
You were given a \c[2]Lugr Pistol\c[0] and 5 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]
The war was cruel and inhumane. You had to take part in countless\#things better left unspoken.
The only thing that kept you going was the thought of your new\#family waiting for you back home. Every night you'd read letters\#from home and fall asleep to a photograph of Elise.
One day the letters ended. It was natural for letters to get\#lost in all the chaos, but you couldn't help your ominous feelings...
So when the Kingdom of Rondon finally withdrew from the war, you\#rushed straight back home as fast as possible...
The manor of Von Dutch was lifeless and dark on that gloomy day.\#You stormed through the countless rooms, but couldn't find a soul\#in sight.
That was until you found the basement door partly open. In the\#darkness below you could only tell apart the silhouette of a person\#who had died standing in the middle of swirling ritual circles.
The person was Eihner Von Dutch himself. He had died on the spot\#from what seemed like self-inflicted wounds and cuts.
Each corner of the basement had sacrificial gifts to an old god\#unknown to you. Your heart sank as you recognized just who was\#the main sacrifice of this maddening rite.
You tried to save Elise with any means necessary. You tried to\#exchange vital parts of yourself for the life of her, but that\#didn't work. You tried unspeakable methods for days, but it was\#all in vain. She was too far gone.
Occult had completely swallowed the baron while you were away and\#you could only guess what he had tried to accomplish with this\#unholy ritual.
Upon searching through baron's documents you noticed a certain place\#mentioned frequently time and time again. A town called  Prehevil in\#the country of Bohemia.
The place had something to do with the beliefs of the baron and\#maybe there you'd find at least some sense to this madness.
It wouldn't bring back your old life, but frankly, you had nothing\#else going for you anymore. Only this small clue on what took\#everything away from you.
Answers... That was enough of a reason to get you back on the\#road.
How did you prepare for your trip?
Stock up on alcohol
You managed to find a bottle of \c[2]Beer\c[0] and a bottle of\#\c[2]Vodka\c[0]!
It's been a long and mentally taxing travel to this point...
You hope that whatever you find from this small town could give\#at least some closure to your sorrow...
Despite your homeland suffering greatly from the First Great War,\#you had a peaceful and balanced childhood with both of your\#parents and many siblings.
The northern capital Oldegård was rebuilding their destroyed\#cities, when news about hostilities in the eastern Europa were\#broadcasted on the radio.
It sounded like the beginning of another worldwide war...
You were still too young to take part in defending your borders\#so you had to figure out an alternate way to help out your homefront.
You had a knack for mechanics and electronics, so ultimately it\#came down to those two lines of studies...
Learn electronics
Learn mechanics
You learned \c[2]Short circuit\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Wrench toss\c[0]!
Because you were the eldest child, you had a natural habit of\#taking care of those around you.
Many of your close relatives marched to battle and nothing could've\#gotten you more frustrated than your inability to help people more\#directly.
You had already matured to adulthood, but because of your expertise\#in engineering, your role on the homefront was more important than\#what you could've achieved on the battlefield.
The homefront was in disorder too. Someone had to step up and\#cover the all the missing men now dying far away on some remote\#battlefields.
Your broad shoulders could carry the burden and the increasing work\#load. They had to, because if not you, then who?
During one particularly stormy night, while you were returning\#home after your twelve hour day, you ran into a foreign man on\#a rain soaked alleyway...
The man noticed you and desperately tried to run for it only to\#collapse after weakly ten meters or so.
The man had been shot to the belly. Upon searching his possessions,\#you found his documents that said he was from the Kingdom of\#Rondon, an allied country of Oldegård's.
You thought about what to do for a moment and then...
Reported the man to officials.
Took the man back home and treated his wounds.
You reported the man to the officials of Oldegård. Apparently he\#had just recently travelled from the Eastern Union to Oldegård\#and was suspected for espionage.
There was even a bounty on his head. You got 10 \c[2]Shillings\c[0] for\#finding him. One of the shillings ended up being a \c[2]Lucky coin\c[0]!\#Lucky you!
Something bothered you about the case and you returned to the\#alley where you first found the man. Upon thoroughly searching the\#alleyway, you found a suitcase full of top secret documents stolen\#from the Eastern Union.
On his memo, the man had written down an address that pointed to\#the Kingdom of Rondon.
The documents didn't look like those of an Eastern Union spy.\#They looked the exact opposite in fact. You decided to take the\#papers to Rondon by yourself.
The man stayed unconscious for a week, but slowly recovered thanks\#to your attentive mending.
As days went by, he saw your eagerness to help and frustation\#towards the war. He then revealed his business in Oldegård.
He was part of an underground resistance organization called "Nameless\#Liberty Underground", NLU in short.
The organization had been brewing hidden from watching eyes\#since the dawn of the first Great War. NLU worked across Europa\#trying to subdue the advancement of both Bremen Empire and Eastern\#Union.
The man had important documents that needed to be taken to\#Kingdom of Rondon as soon as possible. Because he couldn't\#obviously take them there himself, he asked if you could take\#his role.
You had been hoping for a chance to work on something bigger and\#this opportunity seemed to be just that.
You packed your bags and set out.
As a thanks for his rescue, the man gave you his \c[2]Officer sword\c[0].
You travelled through Europa all the way to Kingdom of Rondon.\#You found the meeting point described by the man and made contact\#with his colleagues.
It turned out that the man was part of an underground resistance\#organization called "Nameless Liberty Underground", NLU in short.
The organization had been brewing hidden from watching eyes\#since the dawn of the first Great War. NLU worked across Europa\#trying to subdue the advancement of both Bremen Empire and\#Eastern Union.
After talking briefly about the current situation in the eastern\#Europa, you were asked to join the organization. They were running\#low on members and your expertise would surely come handy.
You were lead to their headquarters and you got to choose how\#you'd offer your help...
Help with creating weapons.
Help with creating traps.
You learned \c[2]Weaponcraft\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Trapcraft\c[0]!
NLU had spies everywhere in Europa and beyond. Combining various\#information snippets gathered from across the continent you were\#able to unravel parts of a larger scheme...
The Eastern Union had been working on something malevolent and\#ill-boding in the country of Bohemia and it seemed like Bremen\#wanted to get their hand on this project.
Your deductions got a lot more weight when you heard that Bremen\#army finally occupied Bohemia. NLU sent some of their members\#immediately to the capital of Bohemia, Prehevil, but you quickly\#lost contact to them.
The organization decided to wait and see if their members would\#surface, but you couldn't just sit back and hope for the best.
You decided to take the first train towards Prehevil and find out\#what was going on.
You were told that if you needed support in your mission you'd\#recognize the leader of the Bohemian branch of NLU from her red\#shoes.
With this little information about the task at hand, how did\#you prepare for the trip?
Stock up on spare parts
You managed to find 4 \c[2]Bolts\c[0], 2 \c[2]Duct tape\c[0],\#2 \c[2]Pressure plates\c[0] and 3 \c[2]Scrap metal\c[0]!
You've felt tense since the moment you embarked on this journey.\#Every night you'd see nightmares of the horrors that would wait\#you in Prehevil...
Are they just dreams? You can't help but feel that there is more to\#the dreams than mere logic would dictate.
Your working overalls...? Did you forget to change your clothes?
You could've sworn you were wearing something different...
For the majority of your life you've only known the streets of\#the Vatican City. This is actually the first time in your life\#you're travelling this far from those narrow and crowded alleyways.
Things don't look that fancy elsewhere. Travelling is overrated you\#think to yourself.
In your earliest memories you remember spending time with your\#parents, but then suddenly you just didn't have parents anymore.
You can't remember what happened, but from one point onwards it\#was just you and your sister against the world.
You were still only ten years old but you had to make a living\#somehow...
Become a pickpocket
Become a burglar
Try to lead a honest life
You learned \c[2]Steal\c[0]!
The Vatican City was full of streets kids similar to you and in\#no time you learned the tricks of the trade. You tried your hand\#in pickpocketing.
It worked for some time, but too often you got caught in the act\#which resulted in you getting beaten up.
You learned \c[2]Lockpicking\c[0]!
The Vatican City was full of streets kids similar to you and in\#no time you learned the tricks of the trade. You tried your hand\#in breaking into apartments and stealing all the valuables you\#could carry.
You tried different odd jobs. The only thing common with all of\#them was that eventually you messed things up and got fired.
Still you were able to save up 10 \c[2]Shillings\c[0]!
The streets schooled you hard, but as you grew older you noticed that\#you started to tower over those who bullied you before. If someone\#still tried to do you dirty, you were quickly able to give them a taste\#of your justice.
Because of your size and skills in fighting, you started to attract\#attention of local street gangs that tried to recruit you as their\#muscle. This never sounded right to you.
You had been extorted of your measly salaries too many times.\#You didn't want to do the same to anyone.
But turning down small-time criminals only got you to further\#trouble. Almost every other night you'd end up in street fights.
At one point you realized that you were doing more fighting than\#actual work, not to mention that's where you got most of your money\#too.
You started to consider fighting as your job. Maybe it would be\#worth investing into it more? You started to work out more\#regularly and follow a strict regimen.
Train strength
Bulk up in mass
Improve your footwork
Train your stamina
You tried to train your explosive power so your strikes would pack\#more punch.
You started doing more push-ups, you used animal carcasses as\#punching bags at the local butcher where you worked part-time, you\#climbed fire escape ladders instead of using stairs and so on...
You managed to increase your strength with a couple of levels in\#the end.
You thought that bulking up could make you more resistant to punches.\#So you started eating like a bear, at least tripling your calorie\#intake.
That combined with lifting weights (the sofa at your apartment),\#dragging horse carriages with your body along with other resistance\#exercises proved to have obvious effects.
You managed to increase your defence with a couple of levels in\#the end.
You thought that swift feet would prove useful in boxing ring.\#It wouldn't matter how hard one would punch, if that punch never\#connects.
You spiced up your boxing drills by tying sand bags to your arms\#and feet. Every time you started to get used to the weights, you'd\#double the bags.
You didn't really feel the change until you finally dropped the\#weights and noticed how light and lighting fast your movements were\#without the additional baggage. Your agility leveled up at least\#twice during all that.
You started your days by running the Tiberian river upstream.\#'The ten thousand steps of penitence' located at the heart of the\#city also became familiar to you. Day and night you'd be running\#those stairs up and down.
In the end your stamina did increase and in following fights you could\#easily take one or two more hits than before.
You were doing alright in fights, so much so that you started to\#build a little reputation on the streets.
In no time you moved on to underground boxing rings where there\#was more money on the table and less danger of the opponent\#pulling a knife in the middle of a match.
While you were busy in the ring, your sister had grown into a\#beautiful young woman who attracted all kinds of admirers. It\#would have meant trouble if it wasn't for your mean reputation.
Most low life thugs on the streets knew that they'd have to answer\#to you if they tried anything dodgy.
That didn't mean that there weren't those who tried. She started\#to get close with a known mobster Riccardo Accardo.
He was the heir to the Accardo branch of The Family. The Family\#was an organized body of criminals operating in the Vatican City.
In all intents and purposes The Family was a mafia, but they\#also had deep ties to the church which in turn was running the\#country. So it was a bit more complicated...
Despite being a mobster, Riccardo seemed decent enough. He had a\#flirtatious and flattering way of speaking and in general got\#along with everyone. He took notice in your skills and tried to\#casually recruit you to their ranks.
You politely declined the offer.
Since you didn't take the offer, Riccardo had another one on the\#platter - He proposed that he'd hook you up with a real boxing\#trainer to get you to the next level.
You again declined, but your sister insisted that you'd at least\#try it out. You agreed.
Things started to feel more professional the second you stepped\#inside the gym. The trainer, an elderly gentleman who had an impressive\#record of previous apprentices, was impressed by your raw skills.
He thought that the best way to push you further would be to choose\#where to specialize.
Specialize in accuracy
Specialize in evasion
Specialize in defence
Specialize in offence
You learned \c[2]Bare-fisted proficiency\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Bob and weave\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Perfect guard\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Adrenaline rush\c[0]!
His methods proved effective. Soon you had your first real bout\#in the ring and won the match with relative ease. Your sister\#and Riccardo were there to congratulate you.
You continued with your winning streak. The hype around you was\#growing, slowly even you started to believe the hype.
Riccardo was able to organize big matches one after another. You\#started spending more time inside The Family quarters with Riccardo\#and your sister.
Without noticing it you had been pulled into the criminal world.\#What started as helping out a friend, became a more frequent\#occurrence.
Soon Riccardo showed his true colours as well. He had been building\#you up for a fated boxing match. Apparently your next opponent was\#a former family member who had cut all ties to the organization.\#Your job was to kill him in a boxing match.
You politely declined. But at this point there was no turning back.\#Riccardo reminded that he got your sister back at his flat and she'd\#feel it in her skin if you didn't comply.
You didn't know what to do. Soon you found yourself in the ring\#with the ex-family member and the bell rang. He was a tough\#opponent but you managed to get the best of him. You were able to\#counter one of his attacks with a knock out hit.
Things moved in slow motion as you saw Riccardo in your corner\#nodding with a sly smile. You followed up your hit with another,\#and another, and another.
You didn't even stop when the man hit the ground. The referee\#had to pull you away with all he got before you stopped.
The damage had already been done. You had killed a person.
You were devastated by all this, but kept it all inside.
This was only the beginning. Riccardo had plenty of dirty work\#for you to do and at this point he had plenty of leverage too. Your\#sister being the last resort everytime you hesitated.
Things had to change.
Get rid of Riccardo
Get your sister and flee the country
You learned \c[2]Killing intent\c[0]!
Riccardo was wary of you. He seemed to sense your killing intent\#from miles away and that's why he avoided seeing you alone to the\#best of his abilities.
He was too cocky to consider you a serious threat though.\#As if he had you under his thumb. That proved out to be a grave\#mistake. For him.
You were to meet Riccardo and a dozen of his henchmen at a local\#club to discuss another one of your many tasks. You had been\#waiting for an opportunity to see him alone, but that opportunity\#never presented itself. 'Fair enough' you thought.
The moment you got to a punching distance, Riccardo had a split-\#second realization of what was happening before you knocked him\#off his feet.
The little rat tried to slither away but you grabbed him by his\#throat and kept slamming him on the floor until he stopped moving.
In your rage you lifted him up and threw him over the railing.\#He fell from the second floor to the center of the club's dance\#floor.
You saw him fall head first to the ground. You had succeeded in what\#you set out to do. Getting out of the club was secondary.
You had to fight through a mob of Riccardo's goons. Somehow you\#made it out from the backdoor with only minor injuries and ran\#away as fast as you could.
You learned \c[2]Escape plan\c[0]!
You couldn't find your sister anywhere. Calling her telephone,\#nothing.
You started to suspect that Riccardo had suspected something like\#this and sent your sister somewhere. You were left with no choice\#but to confront Riccardo.
You ran away from the crime scene. The problem was that now both\#the Family and the law enforcement of the city were after you.
Just then you received a phone call from your sister. She had been\#sent to Riccardo's summer villa in the country of Valland some days\#prior.
You explained the situation to her and the two of you decide to\#meet up in the country of Rondon. There was no possibility of\#you living in Vatican City anymore.
You had to act fast before the police would catch up on you.\#What did you take with you before leaving the city?
Take your luxury products with you
You took 2 \c[2]Blue vials\c[0] and a \c[2]Cloth fragment\c[0]!
You took 2 \c[2]Dried meats\c[0] and a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0]!
You took a syringe of \c[2]Heroin\c[0] and some \c[2]Pep pills\c[0]\#with you!
You took the first train that left the country. The destination\#was an obscure little town called Prehevil in the country of\#Bohemia. You had no idea where that place was, but you figured\#you could plan your trip better once you got there...
No, give me the full text adventure
No, give me the abridged version
You were born and raised in the raging heats of Abyssonia.\#The continent with a long history embedded with chaos and warring\#factions.
Those fools. The people around you waged wars over ancient disputes\#and grudges started by long gone ancestors.
But that is how it had always been. The people of Abyssonia held\#ancestors and their spirits on a godlike pedestal.
But it's not like it was any better in the north, in the continent\#of Europa. Those fools worshipped ancient deities that none of them\#had ever even seen with their own eyes.
And they certainly had their disputes as well. A Great War after\#another. What's worse, their disputes didn't stay within their\#borders. They dragged everyone into their mess.
They had set their eyes on Abyssonia now because of its strategic\#position in securing an access to oil and other raw materials from\#the east.
It was only a matter of time before their troops would march on\#your land.
You were not going to die because some faceless puppeteers chose\#to focus their magnifying glasses on your home country this time.\#Despite your young age, you decided to leave.
Your siblings and mother would mourn your departure. They wanted\#you to have something to remember them by.
Take your family \c[2]Chac chac\c[0]
Take your father's memento, \c[2]Soul stone\c[0]
You took the \c[2]Chac chac\c[0] with you.
You took the \c[2]Soul stone\c[0] with you. It was said to hold your\#father's spirit in it.
You had considered yourself as successfully dead inside, not swayed\#by emotions, but it took a lot of effort to convince yourself that\#you wouldn't miss your family. You still obviously had weaknesses\#to weed out.
You headed to the City of the Sun - Amon to educate yourself on\#spiritualism and religion. You were no slough physically, but you\#always considered your intellect your true forte.
And just like that you were accepted as an apprentice after some\#preliminary tests. At the same time news about the Great War\#closing Abyssonian borders were all they could talk on the radio.
Amon was far from the borders and it would probably remain safe\#for a good while even after a war broke. You figured you'd still\#have plenty of time to learn at the temple and leave the country\#before it was too late.
At the Temple of Amon you were given a choice to learn various\#different schools of spiritualism.
Learn of worship in Europa
Learn magic from Eastern Sanctuaries
Learn methods of your home country
The worship in Europa focused on the older god Alll-mer, but among\#scholars it wasn't too uncommon to worship even more obscure deities.
Learn of Alll-mer
Learn of Gro-goroth
Learn of Sylvian
Learn of God of Fear and Hunger
Learn of Vinushka
Learn of the Moon God
Your affinity with the Alll-mer grew.
Your affinity with the Gro-goroth grew.
Your affinity with the Sylvian grew.
Your affinity with the God of Fear and Hunger grew.
Your affinity with the Vinushka grew.
Your affinity with the Moon God grew.
You learned \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
You learned \c[2]Meditation\c[0].
You were talented and praised for your quick learning at the temple.\#But that came as no surprise to you. You knew you were smarter\#than most of those old geezers. They only possessed knowledge you\#wanted, once you had that, they served no purpose to you.
More time you spent at the temple, more pathetic the priests of Amon\#started to look in your eyes. Religion in general started to look\#dubious too after examining how the world functioned.
Most religious doctrines were molded to accommodate the current\#ruling class. Religion was used as a mere tool to control masses\#more than anything else. Dedicating your life to worship would equal\#dedicating your life to kings and queens of the time.
You had left your home because you didn't want to die fighting\#someone else's war, so why would you waste your life serving\#someone else in turn?
Around this time you found an old scroll from one of the many Amon\#libraries. The scroll mentioned an old sect of magical practitioners\#originating from Eastern Sanctuaries whose world view seemed more\#appealing to you.
'Yellow mages' differed from your typical priests. Instead of\#dedicating their lives to worship, gods existed for them. Their\#force was to be harnessed to further one's own personal growth and\#agenda.
Instead of finding order from the commandments laid out by the\#older gods, yellow mages reveled in chaos. Chaos was the natural\#state the world would return to time and time again, so why even\#try and force it to anything else?
You quit at the temple of Amon and decided to head east in pursuit\#of these 'yellow mages'.
'Need'? Why did you need knowledge and power again? As time went\#on this question started bothering you more frequently. You realized\#you were without a purpose. Without an ideology to fight for.
You quit at the temple thinking that you'd need to forge a path of\#your own. You had left your home because you didn't want to die\#fighting someone else's war, so why would you waste your time\#learning to worship someone else in turn?
Most religious doctrines were molded to accommodate the current\#rulers after all. In your eyes religion was used as a tool to\#control masses more than anything else. Dedicating your life to such\#would equal dedicating your life to kings and queens of the time.
You were above that.
You travelled beyond your home continent, ultimately finding\#yourself at the narrow streets of Eastern Sanctuaries. You got\#acquainted with the local temples. Even they had adopted the worship\#of Alll-mer as their main religion.
Eastern Sanctuaries were no better than the temples of Amon in\#that regard. If anything, religion was even more prevailevant there\#and dictated the way people were to live and die.
You were looked down upon by the scholars and religious leaders of\#the area because of your very public opinions. That didn't bother\#you. You knew better.
In time your conviction convinced the facets you wanted. You were\#approached by a group of travelling mages who wore colourful attires.
The yellow mages that were still around in this day and age were\#reduced to small separate groups wandering around the world to\#study all fields of the otherwordly. The group saw the potential in\#you and offered a place among them.
You liked what you heard and decided to join the wandering group.\#What did you specialize in?
Learn basic techniques
Learn more advanced magic
You learned \c[2]La Danse Macabre\c[0], the traditional dance of the\#yellow mages that channels otherwordly powers close to you.
You learned \c[2]Hurting\c[0].
Your path of learning and self-growth knew no end. Your travels\#brought you to a small bordertown in Eastern Sanctuaries. There you\#met a curious person. Hadil Azif, a self-proclaimed wizard from the\#far east.
Despite his pretentious appearance, his family name 'Azif' was\#well known and even somewhat feared in certain occult circles which\#gave his claims at least some credibility.
He was gathering a group of adventurers to accompany him on a\#perilious quest. He had inherited a map from his late grandfather\#that was supposed to lead him to the infamous dungeons of fear and\#hunger itself.
The place used to be a noteworthy location of pilgrimage for many\#aspiring mages and priests in the distant past. The yellow mages\#you had spent time with previously told ominous tales about the\#dungeons as well.
Initially you dismissed Azif's talks only to be haunted by the most\#brutal nightmares on the following night. Something was calling for\#you. You had to witness the place yourself.
You joined the motley crew of adventurers Azif had managed to put\#together and travelled through war-torn Europa. Most of the crew\#quit half-way to Rondon because of how difficult it was to cross\#borders during those chaotic times.
The closer to the destination you got, more feverish your dreams\#became. The remaining members of your ragtag fellowship were\#visibly sick from stress and otherwordly pressure that had befallen\#on you the moment you set out on your quest.
The breaking point was the day you were to finally arrive at\#the dungeons. A heavy fog drowned your camp and made navigation\#impossible. Using compass a did no good as the thing was just\#spinning circles wildly.
Distant growls and howls created unrest. Not that there was any\#need for that as superstition and constant misfortune had already\#convinced your fellow travellers that this trip was cursed from\#the start.
Your companions panicked and scattered to the mist. Azif himself\#had been sick from constant nightmares for half the trip already.\#You left him curled up in fetus position in his tent and ventured\#forward on your own...
After walking for a while you started to make out something behind\#the thick white veil... The mist revealed a structure of some kind...\#They were medieval ruins of a fortress. Or what had been a fortress\#back in the day. Now they were just a rubble of rock and stone.
Someone had set up modern tents beside the fortress entrance.\#It looked like an archeological expedition had been studying the\#area somewhat recently. The site looked abandoned now.
The fortress felt menacing the closer you got to it. Its insides\#were pitch black. No light penetrated the eternal darkness that\#resided in that god-forsaken place. You braved through your initial\#fight-or-flight reaction and walked in.
The dungeons were as dilapitated as their outerior suggested.\#You cautiously explored the place in a torch light. You didn't get\#far when you already heard gutteral growls echoing in the empty\#hallways.
You were not alone in the darkness. The morbid tales about the\#ruins started to sound more plausible the deeper you got. Maybe\#you would've turned back too if it wasn't for a strange voice\#echoing inside your head.
Something seemed to be calling you from the depths.
You continued to search the dungeons one room at a time. Most valuables\#had been looted over time, but behind a collapsed tunnel you managed to\#find an old bookshelf with a set of books that caught your interest.
Pick \c[2]Skin bible - Gro-goroth\c[0]
Pick \c[2]Skin bible - Rher\c[0]
Pick \c[2]Skin bible - Sylvian\c[0]
You got \c[2]Skin bible - Gro-goroth\c[0]!
The manuscripts all seemed to be part of a bigger compilation and\#you would have loved to have all of them with you. But you had a\#job to do and you couldn't burden yourself with too much extra\#luggage.
You got \c[2]Skin bible - Rher\c[0]!
You got \c[2]Skin bible - Sylvian\c[0]!
Your initial assesment of the abandoned archeological expedition\#proved out to be wrong. The archelogists were still very much there,\#wandering the hallways as ghoulish husks. The darkness had its way\#with those people and they were now bloodthirsty monsters.
The thought did cross your mind that the very same could happen to\#you too if you spent there too long. You had to be hasty in your\#actions.
To deal with the company, you decide to arm yourself once you\#found the remains of what was once the armory of the dungeons.
Pick the \c[2]Officer sword\c[0]
Pick the \c[2]Iron spear\c[0]
What looked like small ruins from the ground level, turned out to\#hide multiple levels of macabre secrets. You passed through old\#torture chambers, prisons suspended above a bottomless chasms,\#huge underground caverns...
All the while the echo in your head became stronger. You were\#clearly getting closer to the source of that mysterious voice.
Finally you found a digging site from caves that were located\#underneath all the horrors. The archeological expedition had reached\#that place before succumbing to the darkness.
They had revealed ruins of an ancient city from a stone wall.\#As you entered the ruins you felt like you entered another time\#entirely. The decor was unlike any culture you were aware of.
What had lead you to the ruins was feverishly calling for you\#beneath the rocks and rubble. You dug the piles with your bare\#hands.
And there it was.\. The source of the voice.
A burnt and mummified severed head. The head had deep lines running\#across its forehead. In the place of its eyes were dark and empty\#sockets. The only hair on the head was the sparse moustache under\#its big nose...
"I wasn't expecting a worm like you weaseling its way this deep to\#the dungeons, but I'll take what I get. All earthworms do after all\#is dig."
"Your garments... Hmph. Maybe you do have more than a camel's spit\#in place of your mind, you are a yellow mage are you not?"
You confirmed the suspicions of this beheaded oddity.
"Figures. That is why a measly maggot like yourself could hear\#my call... Very well..."
"KNEEL BEFORE ME! For I am your master, Nas'hrah the doom and terror\#of the modern man!"
That name, Nas'hrah... That was a name you were not expecting to\#hear. It was a name even the yellow mages only talked in the darkest\#hours of the night.
Nas'hrah the harbinger of the burning crusade. Nashrah the bringer\#of torment. Nashrah the doom and terror of the modern man...\#The great wizard from the Eastern Sanctuaries went by many names.
He indeed was your master. For this beheaded wizard was the one who\#gave birth to yellow mages and their ideology. Only that had happened\#over thousand years earlier. There were no records of Nas'hrah for\#at least 500 years.
"Kueh heh hee. I have a task for you my puny pupil. There is a\#man I want skinned alive. After that I want to RIP OFF THEIR SPINES!\#They will slump before me limp and feeble!"
Your master seemed to be surprisingly up to date with the twists\#and turns the world had taken since his absence. He had a mission\#for you.
As a yellow mage you were supposed to follow your own ambitions and\#greed, but there was a lot you could learn from this death-defying\#wizard that could further your knowledge on dark matters greatly...
You decided to play along. You were sure that this "terror of the\#modern man" was perfectly aware of your reasoning too. That was the\#common relationship between a master yellow mage and their apprentice\#after all.
You were to travel to a small country in the eastern Europa with\#the beheaded wizard. To a town called Prehevil.
Your master promised events of cosmic proportions. The stars were\#aligned for something big to happen. Something that would turn\#the tides of the world for good.
The head left out details from his story on purpose, but that did\#little to bother you. You had just jumped to the deep end of the\#otherwordly world. You couldn't have asked for more.
With this little information about the task at hand, how\#did you prepare for the trip?
Stock up on magical goods
You managed to find 2 pouches of \c[2]Tobacco\c[0] and a \c[2]Condensed lavender\c[0]
You've felt tense since the moment you embarked on this journey.\#Every night you'd see nightmares of the horrors that would wait you\#in Prehevil...
Whatever the price. The opportunity was too interesting to pass.\#With mixed feelings you continued onwards.
After walking for a while you started to make out something behind\#the thick white veil... The mist revealed structures of some kind...
You got to a set of old ruins, or they looked more like a measly pile\#of rubble now. If it wasn't for the dreadful aura eminating from deep\#within, you couldn't tell there was anything remarkable about this\#place whatsoever...
Near the main entrance arch there was a makeshift archeological site\#with tents and digging equipment. The site looked abandoned. On the\#other side there was a side entrance to the dungeons with stairs\#leading down to the darkness below...
Examine the tents
Head to the main entrance
Head to the side entrance
The archeological site seemed relatively new. Maybe a couple years\#old at tops. There were no signs of people. Whoever had set it up\#had long abandoned the place too.
All the documents and reports were written in Bremen so you\#couldn't tell what exactly these people were looking for.
This might have been just a regular archeological excursion that\#stumbled into their certain doom unknowingly. If these truly were\#the dungeons of fear and hunger, then even in their current state\#they would surely swallow unprepared tourists whole.
The moment you stepped inside the dungeon walls you felt immense\#otherwordly pressure. You understood that the place would drain any\#normal person to the brink of madness and starvation in a matter\#of mere hours. You had to be efficient about this.
Even if the day was still bright, the darkness seemed to suffocate\#all light and you could barely see anything ahead of you. You lit\#up a torch.
The side entrance was blocked by a cave in. There was no way around\#the rubble...
Cautiously you walked down the slippery stairs only to find a\#cave in. The hallway had totally collapsed and there seemed to\#be no way around it.
Buried under the rubble there was an old skeleton in a medieval\#leather armor crushed under a ton of rocks. You didn't want to\#suffer the same fate with the skeleton so you returned back.
You stood at the vestibule of the dungeons. To your left you saw\#a doorway leading to what seemed like a kitchen. There was a small\#room with old wooden furniture in front of you and to your right\#there was a closed door.
Check out the kitchen
Check out the room in front of you
Check the door
Go back outside
The room had small stools around a large wooden table covered in\#cobwebs and old stains. At the end of the room there were old\#cupboards and kitchen utilities that had collapsed on the ground.\#The other corner had a row of wooden barrels.
Check the cupboards
Check the wooden barrels
You found old \c[2]Wheat flour\c[0] that still seemed good.
The barrels might have once stored food items, but that was\#hundreds of years ago. There was nothing useful there anymore.
The room had an old wooden desk in front of a partly rotten flag\#that hung on the wall. The flag was that of the old Rondon.\#The opposite wall had half-empty bookshelves facing towards you.
Behind a small pile of rubble you saw a wooden chest covered in\#cobwebs and dust.
Check the wooden desk
Check the bookshelves
Check the chest
Based on some old documents laying on the table it looked like\#the desk had belonged to an army officer from the late 16th or\#early 17th century. You examined all the little drawers on the\#side of the table and found a \c[2]Small key\c[0]!
The few books that were still left were all in a terrible condition.\#None of them looked interesting, but behind a large encyclopedia\#of torture you found an old \c[2]Wine vial\c[0]!
Upon a closer inspection you noticed that the chest's lock was\#busted. Opening the chest confirmed your suspicions - The place had\#been looted long before you ever entered these old ruins.
You were usually able to keep your cool but just the thought of\#something living approaching you in this morbid darkness got your\#heart racing.
You tried opening the door but it didn't budge. You considered\#forcing the door open, but then you heard faint noises coming from\#the other side.
You could have sworn it sounded like something heavy and alive was\#slowly moving towards the door. You had heard rumours of this place\#and you definitely didn't want to confirm whether there was any truth\#to those horror stories or not. You backed away from the door.
You turned around and thought about leaving the darkness, however\#you feared that you might have never been able to return there if\#you had left the place. So just to achieve what you set out to do,\#you decided to stay. As bad as that idea felt to you.
Suddenly you heard loud banging and screeching coming from the\#entrance hall. Adrenaline was rushing through you as you ran back\#to see just what was causing the noise.
The closed door was jolting from its hinges. Something big was\#trying to force its way through the door. Whatever it was, created\#inhuman gutteral sounds between its swings at the door.
Hide in the kitchen
Hide in the room in front of you
Wait and see what it is
Run outside
You quickly waltzed inside the kitchen and pressed again a corner\#where you thought you could stay hidden while still seeing what you\#were up against.
The door crashed open. You saw a dark silhouette of a gigantic\#malformed being push from the open doorway. The creature made\#gurggling noises as it slowly wandered to the other room...
You used this chance to sneak past the thing to the dark corridor\#where it first came from. Only the creature had clearly gotten used\#to the darkness as it sensed you the moment you got out of your\#hiding spot.
You charged to the unknown darkness without a second thought.
You checked the room for any good spots to hide in and decided to\#crouch behind a bookshelf. The place gave you a good vantage point\#while hiding you in the shadows.
The door crashed open. You saw a dark silhouette of a gigantic\#malformed being push from the open doorway. The creature made\#gurggling noises as it slowly wandered to the kitchen...
You braced yourself for whatever was to come. You figured that a\#trained mage like yourself doesn't need to hide from dangers.
The door crashed open and violently a huge malformed beast pushed in\#from the open doorway. The creature looked like it could've once been\#a human, but the darkness had distorted its features beyond recognition.
The malformed archeologist had extra members pushing through his\#trousers, some of which had grown talons just to perverse the human\#physique even further. The beast had noticed you and charged towards\#you with intense hatred.
Attack it with your staff
Cast Hurting on it
Try to evade and run past it
The creature tried to swing wildly with its arms, but you managed\#to dodge and thrust the sharp end of your staff through the beast's\#ribs puncturing its lungs in the process.
To your surprise this did little to slow the creature down. After\#gasping for air for a second it got right back on its feet and\#resumed pursuing you, blood running down in stretched mouth.
The creature tried to swing wildly with its arms, but you managed\#to dodge and finished your chant. You focused all your hatred and\#rage on a small radius around the monster's shoulder which created\#a violent vacuum of energy, the void erased everything in its path.
And just like that a lump of flesh was ripped from the upper torso\#of the malformend archeologist.
Instead of risking your life, you decided to head straight to the\#dark corridor the beast had busted through before.
Your attacks were futile. The creature managed to flail you with\#its lumpy arm before you even had a chance to react. You crashed\#against a wall and felt your ribs give in.
The beast would've continued pummeling you if it wasn't for the\#blinding light shining from the outside. It was obvious that creature\#hadn't seen daylight in ages. The thing tried to shelter its eyes from\#the last rays of the sun, this gave you an opportunity to run past it.
You headed straight to the dark corridor the beast had busted through\#before.
You turned around and considered leaving the darkness, however\#you feared that you might never have been able to return there if\#you had left the place. So just to achieve what you set out to do,\#you decided to stay. As bad as that idea felt to you.
You ran as fast as you could creating distance to the malformed\#beast with each step. You couldn't see much in the darkness, but\#a doorframe that had light shining through its cracks caught your\#attention.
You tackled the door open and stumbled to an overgrown courtyard.\#Quickly glancing back at the dark corridor, you noticed that the\#beast was nowhere to be seen. You figured that the last rays of\#the setting sun still kept it at bay.
You took a breather and slowly walked across the yard. The grass\#had taken a sickly yellow-ish colour and the setting sun created\#ominous shadows as its rays hit the lone gallows standing at the\#center of the enclosure.
As you managed to focus your thoughts, you realized that there was\#an additional voice echoing in your head. Something or someone was\#calling you from the depths of this forsaken fortress.
There was something very curious about this echo. You needed to\#find its source. Not like you had a choice but to delve deeper as\#the sun was rapidly setting down stripping you from the last barrier\#that kept the murderous beast hiding in the shadows.
The courtyard led to another door to the darkness. You pushed\#forward...
You were at the foyer of the dungeons. The hall was large. To your\#left was a lavatory, to your right there was a long corridor leading\#to total darkness and before you rose a large stairway up...
Check out the lavatory
Check out the dark corridor
Check out the stairway
Your torch lit up a row of grimy old toilet seatings. Old blood\#stains were mixed with what looked like semen. You wondered how\#and why you knew such an exquisite little detail...
Investigate the toilet
Jump down the toilet hole
Return to the foyer
There was nothing much to the toilet holes. They were just what\#one would expect them to be.
'I mean why not?' You figured as you slid through the tight toilet\#hole and fell down to the dark pit.
You sank knee deep to the filth and ancient feces. The shit pit\#was narrow and you barely had any room to adjust your stance.
The only faint light source you had after the torch died out was\#the small toilet hole you had squeezed through. There was no way\#to climb back up as the walls were covered in slippery shit that\#gave you no grip whatsoever...
Looks like your journey ended before it could ever even properly\#begin...
Your torch slowly pushed away the darkness as you advanced towards\#the unknown. The further you got, the stronger the echo inside your\#head became. You couldn't make out words clearly, but this was\#definitely the right direction to head.
A larger room opened up behind a set of rusty iron bars. Your torch\#revealed humanlike figures that stood still just beyond the radius\#of the light.
Upon closer inspection you noticed that these figures were medieval\#iron maidens. Human shaped torture devices that had seen practical\#use judging from the old stains that had formed from the seeping\#blood of their victims.
The room had numerous other torture devices as well. Most of them\#would probably be inoperative in this day and age. Among them you\#saw an old reinforced chest and at the back of the room you saw\#a corridor leading to the cells.
Check the corridor
Get back to the foyer
There was nothing more in the chest.
The chest looked old. It might as well have been medieval for all\#you knew. As you tried opening it you realized the lock was still\#fully functioning. You could open it without a proper key...
Use the \c[2]Small key\c[0]
You opened the chest and found 2 \c[2]Bear traps\c[2]!
The chest looked old. It might as well have been medieval for all\#you knew. As you tried opening it you realized the lock was still\#fully functioning. You couldn't open it without a proper key...
You felt a cold draft run across the chamber. The draft seemed to\#be guiding you towards the dark corrider at the end of the room...
Check the dark corridor
You decided to return to the foyer. While walking there you\#carefully tried to listen for any other possible residents of\#these dungeons...
You walked past all the contraptions and bizarre devices, each step\#sticking to the old blood covering the floor...
The corridor that opened up was a long one with multiple cell\#doors covering each side. At the end there were large bars sealing\#off a staircase. Only a rusty old lock stood in your way towards\#the deeper darkness.
Check the cell doors
Check the gate at the end of the corridor
Return to the torture chamber
All the doors were locked. Your torch barely lit any of the cells\#so there was no telling what was inside of them.
Despite being ancient, the lock seemed surprisingly durable. You\#figured that you needed a key or something similar to open the\#pathway down.
The key didn't fit the lock. The small key had been designed for\#smaller desks or chests.
You returned to the torture chamber. You wondered if the room had\#seen any use since its heyday in the medieval times. Some of the\#blood and gore seemed awfully recent...
Check back at the cells
You headed back to the foyer.
Loud creaks and groans could be heard behind you. Something big had\#just entered the foyer. You figured it must have been the malformed\#archeologist from before. The sun must have set which made it\#possible for the creature to advance through the courtyard...
The creature must have had your scent as his footsteps clearly\#closed in on you at a rapid pace. You had to act fast.
You heard the creature charge through the nearby torture chamber,\#knocking over the iron maidens and crashing through the tables and\#chairs in pursuit of you.
As you turned around, your torch revealed the hulking beast right\#next to you. By then it was too late to react already.
The beast grabbed you violently and snapped your neck like a twig.\#The last thing your eyes registered was the monster's pulsating\#appendage hanging between his legs. Looks like all this just aroused\#the beast...
Looks like your story ended before it ever even properly began...
You heard the creature trash the nearby torture chamber. He was\#right on your heels! You couldn't see him in the darkness, but\#you could sense his intense hatred homing in on you.
The gate was locked with a reinforced lock. You tried to remain\#cool as you hoped for the prison keys to work...
The beast was already charging towards you as you opened the gate\#and slipped inside only seconds before the malformed monster\#smashed againt the bars.
Violently the creature tried reach for you while making low grunt\#noises from his swollen throat.
The bars and the gate seemed to hold the beast for now, but you\#didn't want to stay and find out whether the thing could eventually\#break in.
Instead you took the stairs deeper to the darkness. The thought\#crossed your mind - If darkness had twisted those poor sods to\#become mindless beasts, would the same fate await you if you stayed\#at the dungeons for long enough?
The stairs became sticky from old gore and blood the deeper you\#got. The air was stale and had rotten smell to it.
The voice inside your head got louder. You still couldn't make\#sense of any words but it was definitely calling for you.\#Deeper. You had to get deeper, that much was clear...
You returned to the torture chamber despite knowing what was\#waiting for you there.
You barely got out of the corridor as the malformed beast charged\#at you with full force. You got violently tackled against the wall\#and lost consciousness.
The wide stairway lead to an old Alll-merian sacrificial altar\#with a skeleton crucified to it. Next to the altar there was a\#side path leading deeper inside the fortress.
Go back to the foyer
Examine the altar
Check the side path
The stairs felt steeper when going down. Maybe it had something to\#do with the way the darkness shrouded each step ahead of you. If\#you didn't know any better, the stairs could have kept on going\#forever until you reached the abyss itself.
The altar was a typical ritual crucifix used to worship Alll-mer\#The Ascended One. A sacrifice would be put on the cross and their\#blood would slowly be drained for days to come.
Traditionally such rituals were used for protection. Alll-mer would\#look after the immediate surroundings for as long as the blood was\#running down the cross.
The last sacrifice this cross saw must have been this skeleton.\#There was no blood dripping from the cross anymore, so no protection\#from Alll-mer either.
The stairs felt steeper when going down. Maybe it had something to\#do with the way the darkness shrouded each step ahead of you. If\#you didn't know any better, the stairs could have kept on going\#forever, until you reached the abyss itself.
The path was a narrow corridor crudely made from misshapen bricks\#and stones. It looked like the floor had collapsed at certain points\#but you were able to hop over the trench with ease.
A large room opened up before you. The room stood out with its\#finer decor, spiral floor tiling and its many bookcases covering\#the walls.
The southend corner of the room had a small doorway shrouded in\#darkness. The northend corner was more dilapitated with its caved\#in ceiling and all.
Search the bookshelves
Check the doorway
Most of the books that were still left had been growing mold for\#hundreds of years but there were a handful of manuscripts that\#appeared surprisingly new...
All the skin bible entries lured you to browse them. But you tried\#to keep your head cool. You didn't come to the dungeons because of\#those books.
Your torch slowly lit up the small room and revealed a wooden desk\#with drawers, a carpet that was from Eastern Sanctuaries judging by\#its patterns and a partly eaten corpse that seemed to be part of\#the archelogical expedition.
Search the desk
Search the body
Return to the library
The desk was trashed. Someone must have searched the desk.
Most of the valuables had been looted long time ago already.\#Opening a drawer revealed only old and dusty letters of no importance.\.\#Except something fell from one of the envelopes...
You found a \c[2]White key\c[0].
Most of the valuables had been looted long time ago already.\#Opening a drawer revealed only old and dusty letters of no importance.\#The bottom drawer however seems to be stuck...
Force it open
You kicked the drawer a couple of times and managed to force it\#open.
A \c[2]Lucky coin\c[0] rolled out of the drawer.
The corpse belonged to one of the adventurers who had delved here\#with the archeological expedition. That's what his outfit told at\#least. It was the traditional safari outfit you had seen in movies.
Someone or something had been chewing on the body. There were\#human-like bite marks all over the torso and neck.
You found \c[2]Tobacco\c[0], a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0] and \c[2]Prison keys\c[0]\#after searching his pockets.
Faint whining and moaning could be heard from the partly eaten\#archeologist. The corpse was trying to get on his feet. As it\#stumbled up, a group of keys fell from his lap.
You picked up the \c[2]Prison keys\c[0].
Faint whining and moaning could be heard from the partly eaten\#archeologist. The corpse had trouble getting back on his feet,\#but after a small stumble he already turned his attention on you.
Slowly one step at a time the ghoul approched you with his mouth\#stretched unnaturally open...
Ignore it and return to the foyer
You swung your staff at the ghoul. The staff hit the cheekbone of\#the creature which caved in from the impact, but this did little\#to distract the revitalized archeologist as he took a bite from\#the handle and yanked the staff from your hands.
You finished your chant and focused all your hatred and fury on\#a concentrated spot on the ghoul's soft torso. Like a vortex, the\#energy tore the archeologist's skin and rotten meat and left a\#gaping hole in their place.
To your surprise the ghoul kept on advancing towards you as if\#nothing had happened. You had never faced a living dead before and\#it seemed like traditional means of harm had very little impact on\#someone who felt no fear or pain.
Before managing to attack you tripped to a pile of rubble. As you\#lifted your torch to see, the ghoul already charged towards you\#with surprising ferocity and landed his teeth on your shoulder.
The momentum of the creature tackled you on the ground where the\#ghoul started ripping out your intestines...
You managed to push the creature back just barely and escaped with\#only a minor injury.
You backed away from the room, yet the ghoul kept on following you.\#You cautiously hopped over the collapsed floor in the corridor\#leading up to the library. The creature was not as agile and instead\#face planted on the ground as it tripped on the rubble.
The ghoul was waist deep in the trench, unable to climb back up.\#Desperately he tried reaching out for you with his blood soaked hands.\#The whines and growls turned into agitated shrieks as it furiously\#tried to snatch you.
It looked like the creature was stuck. You figured you'd best\#just leave this area for now and explore elsewhere.
You walked past the collapsed floor, past the sacrificial altar,\#down the stairs, all the way back to the foyer.
The goul was still stuck in the rubble. It seemed like he wasn't\#able to climb up from the trench. The thing just kept reaching out\#for you with saliva dripping from his crooked mouth.
You decide to keep your distance and backed away...
You entered a huge chamber full of partly buried skeletons and\#rotting corpses laying about. The ground had a thick layer of\#dried blood and filth which had accrued around the chamber walls\#over the years.
Each step you took echoed to dizzying heights. You couldn't see\#the chamber ceiling, the walls just rose up forever to the darkness.
There were two staircases in the chamber. One lead to the ground\#level you had just escaped, while the other one lead to lower\#levels. In the middle of the chamber there was a rather new looking\#wooden contraption...
Take the stairs up
Take the stairs down
Examine the contraption
Examine the piles of bodies
You walked up the stairs. The screams of the malformed archeologist\#got louder and louder until you saw the thing still banging on the\#the gate relentlessly.
The gate hinges were starting to get loose. It seemed like the\#creature could have broken in at any moment really. You decided\#to head back down while you still could...
You walked up the stairs. The malformed archeologist was still\#there banging the gate but looked a lot less enthusiastic about\#it than before.
You still couldn't go back, but at least you weren't on a timer\#anymore. It looked less likely by the minute that the thing would\#bust in anymore.
The stairs leading down were sticky with the grime like everything\#else in that chamber. A cold draft moved you along to the chasm\#that awaited you at the bottom.
You didn't notice the gaping hole at the center of the chamber until\#you got closer and your torch lit up the surroundings. The wooden\#contraption had been built around it as a freight elevator of sorts.\#Lifting and lowering items and people if necessary.
The contraption itself stuck out just by not being stained with\#blood and filth like everything else. Judging by some of the\#equipment around, the elevator must have been used by the same\#archeologic expedition that had set up the tents outside.
You could have used the contraption yourself too if you had some\#rope with you...
The wooden contraption had been built around the gaping hole on\#the ground. It was used as a freight elevator of sorts. Lifting and\#lowering items and people if necessary.
Use the \c[2]Rope\c[0]
You tied the rope tightly to the wooden beams and threw the loose\#end down to the pit.
A cold draft could be felt coming from the depths below...
You headed down.
Most of the bodies had been decaying and decomposing for hundreds\#of years. Some bodies looked fresher than the others, while some\#were reduced to bare skeletons.
The ludicrous amount of corpses did raise questions about the\#purpose of this chamber, but there was no one around to answer\#those questions anymore so you just took everything at face\#value.
A giant underground ravine opened up before you. Even your torch\#couldn't properly light up the area. There were iron grid\#platforms suspended above a seemingly bottomless chasm.
The platforms were mounted on cavern walls and linked together\#with a shaky looking bridge. The side you were on had a few\#individual prison cells in a row. What awaited on the other side\#of the bridge was shrouded in darkness.
Return to the upper floor chamber
Check the prison cells
Walk over the bridge
Examine the ravine
You walked up the stairs cautiously. The stale and greasy air\#greeted you upstairs.
You tried opening the cell doors, but all of them appeared locked.\#Some of the locks were too rusty to even function properly anymore.\#There appeared to be no way inside the bars.
Not that you missed anything important. The torch light revealed\#just regular prison utilities like piss buckets, chains and a\#couple of skulls belonging to previous residents.
You cautiously walked up to the bridge. Just putting some weight\#on the thing caused a couple of nuts and bolts fall down to the\#endless depths.
You braved across it. The bridge felt like it was about to collapse\#at any moment, but somehow it remained together. The other side\#of the ravine was more or less identical to the one where you\#just came.
The grid platforms looked old and rusty. The platforms gave\#worrisome creaks as you walked on them. The fact that parts of\#the platform had  already collapsed didn't exactly reassure you\#of their condition.
As you walked to the platforms you heard loud screeching from\#one of the cells.
The noise was coming from the exact cell you feared it would.\#The huge creature in the cell had waken up from its slumber.
The noise seemed to come from one of the cells at the end of the\#platform. Something trapped inside was causing the ruckus.
A large humanoid creature busted through the cell door. The thing\#was naked revealing its abnormally muscular and scarred physique.\#Its left arm was missing, replaced with what looked like a long\#pole or a rod full of thorns and other sharp projections...
The most striking feature however in this abomination was its head.\#The thing had a head of a crow. And it was not just a mask, the\#feathers seemed to be growing down its neck as well.

You couldn't help but take a few steps back. That strong was the\#killing intent eminating from the thing.
Attack with your staff
Cast a hurting on it
Try to slip by it
The crow gave a loud kaw that was mixed with a deep resonating\#growl of an anguished man and attacked you by swinging its mauling\#arm furiously at you.
You managed to dodge the swing and thrust the sword through the\#creature's side puncturing its ribs.
The crow was apathetic towards your attacks. The sword was stuck\#in its ribs, but it didn't seem to slow the creature down at all.
You grounded the iron spear on the ground and let the creature's\#own weight do the work for you. The crow came at you with such\#force that the spear impaled its abdomen without slowing it down\#the slightest.
The crow was apathetic towards your attacks. The creature stood up\#straight with the spear still jutting out from its gut. The thing\#showed no signs of pain.
You tried to counterattack the creature's swing with the staff,\#but it just broke into splinters as the freak arm of the thing\#swung by.
The crow was apathetic towards your attacks. It just kept staring\#through you with its lifeless eyes.
You jumped back while chanting the spell. You lifted your hand\#and targeted the creature's chest. You focused all your pent up\#rage on that very spot. You dug deep to all the great wrongs\#done to you in you short life...
The vortex that followed blasted a clean hole through the creature.
The crow had blood dripping from its gaping wound and its beak,\#but it kept advancing towards you regardless of its wounds.
You tried to slip past the creature. First you dodged another\#swing coming your way and then leaped on the annexing bridge\#just barely escaping beyond the crow's reach.
You ran across the bridge, the creature followed hot on your\#trail. The shaky bridge clattered under your feet. Just as you\#made it on the other side, the whole thing fell to pieces.
The hulking mass of the crow mauler was too much for the antique\#construction. The creature slumped down to the endless chasm with\#the collapsing parts and pieces.
You dodged the initial swing and tried to counterattack immediately\#after, but unfortunate for you the creature followed its attack by\#pecking you with its large beak.
The crow tried to go for your head but only managed to take\#a chunk out of your shoulder. It was scary how easily the thing\#managed to wound you almost mortally.
If the peck was just centimeters to the left, it would have ripped\#your arteries.
There were 3 cells in a row. At the end of the platform there was\#a corridor leading away from the ravine back to solid ground.
Go to the corridor
Return to the other side
All the cells were locked. One cell in particular caught your\#attention. There was a huge, naked creature inside. Its features\#looked human but the person must have been at least 2,5 meters\#tall, if not more...
The upper body of the thing was shrouded in darkness...
For a moment you thought the creature was still breathing...\#But you figured it must have been just the flickering torch\#creating illusions. Surely.
You walked away as quietly as possible regardless.
You returned to the cell just to check up on the creature. Better\#be cautious than sorry...
This time you were convinced of it. This thing, whatever it was,\#was still alive and breathing.
You wondered if the bars and the cell door would be able to hold\#the creature if it turned out hostile...
The corridor took you to a small intersection. To your left there\#was a doorway to a small room, and to your right the corridor\#continued deeper to the darkness.
Check back on the chasm
Check the small room
Head deeper to the darkness
You heard distant chains rattle by the chasm...
Seems like the small commotion caused by your exploration reached\#the ears of someone or something...
A loud creak echoed from the ravine...
The dungeons were dead silent apart from the small ruckus caused\#by you going through the officer's room. Whatever still lived in\#the darkness would hear you loud and clear.
You heard an ear piercing screech. It sounded like a cell door was\#just forced open. Steady scraping sounds closed in on you as you\#felt a terrifying presence advance in the dark.
Hide behind the wooden desk
You hid behind the desk and tried to get a decent vantage point as\#the scraping noises grew louder and louder...
A huge humanoid creature entered the room. The thing was naked\#revealing its abnormally muscular and scarred physique. Its left\#arm was missing, replaced with what looked like a long pole or rod\#full of thorns and other sharp projections...
The most striking feature however in this abomination was its head.\#The thing had a head of a crow. And it was not just a mask, the\#feathers were growing down its neck too.
Its empty glaring eyes seemed to stare right through you from the\#darkness of the doorway.
The crow gave a loud kaw that was mixed with a deep resonating growl\#of an anguished man. That was all the warning you got as it charged\#straight at you.
You tried to keep a cool head as the scraping sounds became louder\#and louder...
A huge humanoid creature appeared from the dark. The thing was\#naked revealing its abnormally muscular and scarred physique. Its\#left arm was missing, replaced with what looked like a long pole or\#rod full of thorns and other sharp projections...
Its empty glaring eyes seemed to stare right through you.

choice_text 2 Attack with your \c[2]Iron spear\c[0]
The creature swung furiously at you with its left mauler arm.
Try to defend
You tried desperately to defend yourself against mauling arm, but\#it was all in vain. The swing had a terrifying force behind it and\#you got crushed against the floor, almost losing your consciousness.
You didn't even have time to lift your weapon as the mauling arm\#crushed you against the floor.
You didn't have time to even start chanting the spell as the\#mauling arm crushed you against the floor.
The creature knew perfectly well how to utilize the dreadful weapon\#as its thorns and spikes scraped the skin of your back.
You were surprised by the mercy shown as the crow finished you\#quickly with just one additional swoop that broke your spine.
The room looked like it had once belonged to an army officer.\#There were numerous weapon racks in the room positioned next to\#an empty shelf. At the back of the room there was a wooden desk\#with an impressive looking leather recliner behind it.
Behind the desk you noticed a small cast iron chest and what seemed\#like a rusty lever.
Check the weapon racks
Check the lever
Return to the corridor
There were few swords and spears still left on the rack. It looked\#like there might have once been more but looters had probably taken\#everything that looked half-decent and valuable.
One of the swords wasn't complete rubbish and one of the spears\#appeared to be in a surprisingly good shape. You couldn't carry\#both around. You didn't want to over-encumber yourself after all.
Leave them
You decided to leave them both for now...
The weapon rack looked even more empty now. You figured that the\#next poor soul to wander down to these ruins could have your leftovers.
The desk and its drawers had been ransacked long ago already.\#Instead you tried looking for things that were less obvious to\#common thieves and treasure hunters...
You examined the bottom of the desk and found a hidden trap door.
A \c[2]Pipe\c[0] and a pouch full of \c[2]Tobacco\c[0] fell from the\#hidden compartment.
The desk and its drawers had been ransacked. You didn't even bother\#looking too carefully as you were sure all the valuables were long\#gone by now.
The chest had a thick and durable looking lock. It must have been\#just that too as it had survived the test of time and undoubtedly\#a myriad of looters.
The key fit the lock perfectly.
The chest was almost empty. Only a small ring was laying on the\#bottom. You got \c[2]Thorned ring\c[0]!
You tried forcing it open, but with no luck. If all the thieves from\#past several hundred years had given up on the chest, it would've\#been very unlikely that it was you who would've finally been the one\#to break the thing.
There was nothing more left in the chest.
It looked like a mechanical lever used to control something...\#You tried pulling it, but it was stuck. It didn't budge even a\#little.
It was a curious little thing, but its purpose would remain a\#mystery to you.
You torch pushed away the darkness. The dancing light flickered on\#a lone skeleton chained on the wall. The corridor circled back\#to the great chasm and its suspended platforms.
The grid iron bridge connecting the two sides had completely\#collapsed on this end of the ravine.
You noticed a rope tied on the platform. On the other end of the\#rope you saw a corpse belonging to the archeological expedition.\#This person had apparently hanged himself. The horrors of the\#dungeons must have been too much for him.
Lift up the corpse
Head back
You saw faint shapes in the darkness. The platforms seemed to\#continue on the other side. God knows how large this man-made area\#really was...
You pulled the corpse up.
You were right in your assessment. The person had modern clothing\#that looked like that of a stereotypical western archeologist.
The person had nothing of value. You did pick up the \c[2]Rope\c[0] though.
Your footsteps were the only thing echoing in the air apart from\#occasional water droplet heard in the distance as you headed back.
There was a doorway to a small room on your right and in front\#of you was the vast open area with all the cells. The prison area.
Go to the small door
Go check out the cells
Head back to the dark corridor
There was nothing there apart from the corpse you had pulled up.
Examine the corpse
You checked all the pockets but found nothing of value.
Walking back and forth the bridge didn't feel like such a good idea.\#If anything, the bridge felt even shakier than before.
You realized something now that you looked the ravine from the other\#side...
Next to the man-made plaforms, in the darkness, there were huge\#statues carved on the cavern walls where the brick walls of the\#prison area ended.
The statues were figures from olden times, clad in armor, only\#their appearance wasn't that of humans. No, these figures appeared\#more reptilian.
The appearance and the condition of the statues suggested that they\#were a lot older than anything that had been built around them over\#the years. They were probably there even before the whole fortress\#existed in the first place.
You were standing on a grid iron platform that was suspended above\#the dark ravine that opened up below you. The bridge that had\#linked the platform to the other side had collapsed entirely with\#the crow.
The side you were on had a few individual prison cells in a row\#and a stairway back up where you initially came from.
Check the bridge remains
As you walked back up, you once again heard the echo inside your\#head. This time you could almost understand some words...
"... Deeper... You must delve... Deeper..."
The correct path must have been somewhere at the bloody chamber.
You walked to the bridge remains and looked down. The chasm was\#deep. Very deep.
The creature couldn't have survived the fall. That's what you\#kept saying to yourself anyway.
The grid platforms looked old and rusty. The platforms gave\#worrisome creaks as you walked on them. The whole thing seemed\#even shakier now that the annexing bridge had fallen to the pit.
You climbed down the claustrophobic bloody pit. The pit opened\#up and the area that revealed itself was even more open than\#the ravine upstairs. There was a huge cavern beneath the fortress\#ruins.
The rope ended up on top of a crashed wreckage. An iron cage had\#crashed on the rocky ground from the pit you came from. A closer\#inspection suggested that it was an elevator of some kind. Needless\#to say it wasn't functional anymore.
You stood on solid ground next to the wreckage. The cavern was huge.\#Your torch light left you standing in the middle of darkness with\#no points of interest apart from a makeshift campsite with a couple\#of tents and some archeological equipment.
Climb back up
Examine the elevator wreckage
Check the campsite
Head to the darkness
You looked up the rope. The climb was long. You didn't want to\#go back and forth many times, so you decided to search the caverns\#first before heading back.
The iron frame of the elevator had bent from the fall. There was\#still a broken chain hanging on the roof. The chain must have lifted\#and lowered the elevator when necessary back when the elevator was\#still functioning.
As you walked up to the tents you noticed that there were no signs\#of life there. The archeological crew was gone.
The campsite had a couple of tents side by side, open crates\#full of digging equipment and a makeshift table full of various\#documents scattered around. Behind the camp you found a larger\#digging site.
Go back to the elevator wreckage
Check out the tents
Check out the documents
Go to the digging site
You turned around and decided to check up the wreckage once again.
The first tent had sleeping bags and clothing scattered about.\#Among the useless junk you managed to find 5 \c[2]Matches\c[0]!
The second tent was mostly the same story except there was a\#collection of archeological findings on a table.
After your initial excitement you noticed however that those\#findings were only run-of-the-mill artifacts, pieces of broken\#vases and other trinkets of no use.
Among the junk you picked up an \c[2]Ornament lantern\c[0].
The first tent had sleeping bags and clothing scattered about.\#Useless junk for the most part.
Too bad the findings were only run-of-the-mill artifacts, pieces\#of broken vases and other trinkets of no use.
Only... This time you noticed something hidden under a sleeping bad.\#Someone from the archeological crew must have tried to hide it from\#the others.
You found a \c[2]Small thing's amulet\c[0]!
The documents were written in Bremen, so you couldn't make sense\#of them really. There were some very official looking papers among\#them which suggested that the expedition orders came from someone\#high up in Bremen office. Maybe even from the Kaiser himself?
A report documented each item found from the digging site. There\#were pictures of the said items etched on paper. The items looked\#mundane for most parts, but all of them had carvings on them that\#were unlike anything you had seen before.
They didn't match with any culture you were aware of.
One document caught your interest especially. It had a sketch of a\#cubic object with various ornaments and sigils carved all across it.
Something about this item raised the hair on your arms and made\#you sick from stomach. There was something special about this cube,\#no doubt about it...
The digging site was bigger than how it looked initially. The site\#expanded to nearby cliffs with wooden platforms leading down to a\#dark chasm.
Go back to the campsite
Go down the wooden platforms
You descended down to the dark depths. The echo inside your head\#returned once again. '...Misguided soul, can't you hear my call...?'\#The words were clear this time around.
"Good... Finally..." The voices became ever more clearer.
The archeological crew had been digging deep and revealed something\#that should've stayed hidden. Ancient structures could clearly\#be seen protruding from the rocky surface.
The structures looked almost like remains of a city from another\#time. The wooden platforms took you straight to them and a ladder\#was set to lead you inside what looked like a temple or some other\#place of worship.
You climbed in.
Most of the temple was dilapitated by the time, but you could still\#spot some murals on the walls that depicted rituals and gods not\#known in this day and age.
Even if you only witnessed glimpses of something larger, the scale\#of the building already impressed you. It was unlike anything you\#had ever seen. Eastern Sanctuaries, The city of Amon, Abyssonia...\#They all paled in comparison.
The voice inside your head was getting loud. 'This way. This way.\#This way. This way! This way! THIS WAY! THIS WAAYYY!'
You dug the rubble with your bare hands. You turned over wooden\#structures and pushed away a stone pillar...
A burnt and withered head. A severed head to be more precise.
The head had deep lines running across it. In the place of its\#eyes were dark and empty sockets. The only hair on the head was\#the sparse moustache under its big nose...
'I wasn't expecting a worm like you weaseling its way this deep to\#the dungeons, but I'll take what I get. All earthworms do after all\#is dig.'
'Your garments... Hmph. Maybe you do have more than a camel's\#spunk in place of your brains, you are a yellow mage are you not?'
'Figures. That is why a measly maggot like yourself could hear\#my call... Very well...'
'KNEEL BEFORE ME! For I am your master, Nas'hrah the doom and\#terror of the modern man!'
'Kueh kueh. You are a lucky bastard. Lucky indeed.'
'There is a man I want skinned alive... After that I want to\#RIP OFF THEIR SPINES! THOSE MAGGOTS! They will\#slump before me limp and feeble!'
As a yellow mage you were supposed to follow your own ambitions\#and greed, but there was a lot you could learn from this\#death-defying wizard that could further your knowledge on dark\#matters greatly...
You decided to play along. You were sure that this 'terror of the\#modern man' was perfectly aware of your reasoning too. That was\#the typical relationship between a master yellow mage and their\#apprentice after all.
You started walking to the darkness with your torch working as the\#only source of light. As you walked away from the wreckage the voice\#echoing inside your head became more distant. The further you got\#the more aggravated it got too.
Whatever was the source of these voices, it obviously didn't want\#you to go this way.
Keep on walking
Go back to the wreckage
You decided to turn back before getting lost in the darkness.
You walked straight until you ran into a rock wall. The wall rose\#up beyond the radius of your torch light.
Head back to the wreckage
Continue along the wall
You were a bit unsure about the direction, but luckily you chose\#the right way and found yourself back where you started.
You kept walking. The ground was pretty even and in general the\#terrain was fairly easily traversable.
Pretty soon you found yourself at the edge of an cliff. The sight\#reminded you of the ravine upstairs. Most likely the chasm before\#you was the very same.
The place looked like a dead end, so you traced back your\#footsteps back to the elevator wreckage.
That proved out to be more difficult than you expected. The ground\#was hard so there were barely any footsteps left on it. After\#meandering about for a good while, you stumbled upon the wreckage\#just by sheer accident. Lucky you.
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\#\c[7]"We're in 'his' radius now. Better not let me down now."\c[0]
You were always a curious child. Your elder siblings and your nanny\#had to keep you out of the harm's way to the best of their\#abilities. Just a moment's lapse in their vigilance and you'd be\#running behind a corner for one of your many misadventures.
Your parents were always busy. They had very little time for you\#and your brothers, instead you were mostly raised by Dalia, the\#nursemaid of the household. A tall woman in her 30s originating\#from the Eastern Sanctuaries.
In your memories she was alright, but something always felt 'off'\#about her...
Your parents were fresh aristocrats in the Bremen Empire. Despite\#being highly thought of, they were outsiders among the noble for\#they had risen to power by their own means and thus didn't have\#strong roots among the other blue blood of Bremen.
This proved out to be a problem when tensions within Bremen borders\#were rising with different factions rising to prominence around the\#country.
The situation looked bad for your family as you didn't have\#strong lineage to back you up. When the time came to throw someone\#at the wolves to please the general public, the Sauer family was\#the first to go.
Certain populist factions were able to agitate the common people to\#start riots and a huge mob headed towards your family manor.
In a hurry your parents gave you to Dalia's safe keeping and told\#her to leave the country. They would look you up when things had\#settled down.
Or that's at least what Dalia told you afterwards. You were still a bit\#young to remember properly. But you could've sworn that Dalia never\#consulted your parents about your departure.
In your memories Dalia just flat out kidnapped you.
Whatever the case, you and Dalia travelled to Jettaiah, the capital of\#the Eastern Sanctuaries, recently named Eastern Union after they\#joined forces with the Voroniyan Republic.
The culture shock was quite drastic, you had never seen such poverty\#and such riches, side by side in the street view. All the unfamiliar\#sounds and scents from spice vendors that circled your automobile...
It was all too much for you as you were growing restless by the\#minute. Dalia struggled to contain you as you opened the car door\#and jumped out of the moving vehicle.
Convince passersby that you've been kidnapped
Run through the crowded streets and hide
You learned \c[2]Persuade\c[0]!
Despite the language barrier, you managed to convince some of the\#people of your distress. Once Dalia came following with her excuses,\#she had a lot of convincing to do to get the people give you back to\#her.
Dalia tried to assure you that you had nothing to worry about, but\#once again she gave that 'off' feeling. You didn't know what it was,\#but you seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to judging people's\#character and honesty.
But there was not much you could do. You were still considered just a\#child after all.
You threaded through the crowds quickly and gracefully. All the years\#of playing tag with your brothers paid off. You shook off Dalia with\#ease.
However once the evening came and you grew hungry, you weren't so\#certain about your plan anymore.
You heard Dalia yell for you tirelessly even after all these hours.\#You decided to give yourself in and reveal your location. You were\#still just a child after all, what were you going to do instead?
So you ended up living with Dalia in a rather decent looking building.\#She was cashing cheques to maintain your lifestyle.
Dalia's version of the truth was that your parents were looking\#after you by sending money, but you had a feeling that it was\#just ransom money Dalia kept spending.
It wasn't all bad though. Growing up in the Eastern Union gave you\#some perspective at the very least.
The way the local authority oppressed the locals made you wary of\#those in power. In your teenage years you started spending more time\#with various civil rights organizations that were active in Jettaiah.
During one of the weekly protests the local army decided to make\#an example of your group. Without mercy the armored officers\#pummeled brutally those in the first rows of the demonstration.
Help those who were wounded
Grab a pistol from one of the officers and defend yourself
Run away
Lucky you had prepared for situations like this and you had various\#first aid item with you.
You got 4 \c[2]Cloth fragments\c[0] and 2 \c[2]Blue vials\c[0]!
You tried to bandage one of your unconscious comrades, but the army\#officers reached you in no time and proceeded to beat you to the\#ground.
You got a \c[2]Lugr pistol\c[0] and 6 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]!
You noticed an unconscious army officer on the ground. You picked\#up his pistol in a hurry, pointed the gun at the opposing forces\#and shot.
You managed to hit one of the officers, but you only managed to shoot\#his thigh. In return he answered your fire with fire and shot you in\#the abdomen. You fell down immediately. The pain was excruciating.
You were able to push through the panicking masses that were all\#trying to escape from the narrow streets. You knew these alleys well\#and in no time you got back to you flat where you resided with Dalia.
Unfortunately a foreigner like yourself stood out in the protest and\#soon you had army officers at your doorway. With great force they\#pushed you on the ground which knocked you out immediately.
You woke up in the hospital. There were people from the Bremen\#embassy waiting for you to wake up. Apparently the protest had\#gained some publicity and they had noticed you on a television.
You explained your situation to them and they took you in their\#custody. Soon you were already on a plane flight headed back to\#Bremen.
You were returned to your mother and her new husband. The rioting\#mobs had burned down your family manor all those years ago and\#your father had died during the unrest.
You never heard of Dalia again, but apparently she had indeed\#kidnapped you and you were living off of ransom money your new\#stepfather had barely been able to put together. Your sixth sense\#seemed to be working as intended.
Your turbulent life had left a mark in you and you had trouble staying\#still for too long. Instead of settling down properly, you became a\#journalist at a very young age.
The situation in Bremen seemed very suspicious to you. A mysterious\#person only known as 'Kaiser' was appointed the chancellor of the\#Bremen Empire without any prior involvement in the country's\#politics.
He had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and taken control of\#the whole country.
Kaiser was partly responsible for what happened to your father as\#it was him who had been riling up people against the nobility of the\#country. But it wasn't just that. You also got major 'off' vibes from\#this person. That's why you dug deep to uncover his past.
Nothing seemed to make sense though. There were connections\#between Kaiser and a so-called secret society called 'The New\#Gods', but that started to sound like a petty conspiracy theory\#the more you read into it.
Still, your sixth sense was tingling. The New Gods were a group that\#had been talked about since the Cruel Ages of history. They were the\#typical secret society, controlling different nations from behind the\#the curtain and puppeteering those seemingly in power.
There were several people in modern global politics linked to this\#group. The more you investigated the subject, the more it started to\#look as if this group was behind the last two great wars that had\#ravaged the world. Something big was definitely brewing in Europa...
When Kaiser occupied Prehevil, the capital of Bohemia only to shortly\#after make a truce with the Eastern Union - that's when your alarm\#bells started to ring loud.
Something was definitely 'off'. You decided to take off and travel\#to Bohemia yourself.
With this long trip ahead of you, how did you prepare for the trip?
Stock up on self-defence items
You managed to buy 5 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0] and a \c[2]Fencing gambeson\c[0]!
You managed to buy \c[2]Lugr pistol\c[0], 5 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0] and\#a \c[2]Fencing gambeson\c[0]!
You remember moths, blue moths - blue noctuid moths to be precise.\#That is your first memory as a child. You and your twin sister sitting\#in the backyard, illuminated by the cold blue hue of the moon.
Instances where it was just the two of you, sharing a moment, were\#rare. That is probably why those moments matter you the most.
You and your twin sister were born at the strike of midnight, at\#the turning point of months. Thus you were born with different\#birthsigns.
One was born with a shadowed soul and one with a radiating soul.
Since that moment it was evident that the two of you would lead very\#different paths in life. Just as predicted, you were the polar opposites\#of each other from very early on.
You were fragile and weak in build, whereas your sister Reila was\#an active and adventurous child that could have easily been an\#athlete if she just chose so.
You stuck indoors reading books for the most of your time. Your\#sister spent her time outside making friends with other kids of\#the neighbourhood.
Despite your differences, you took solace from each other in the\#strict religious household you grew up in. One thing was common\#between the two of you - You both wanted out of the everwatching\#eye of your parents and their religious dogma.
You found escapism from the nature and botanism. Your sister, also\#being academically gifted, took interest in sciences. She would\#dedicate her time to new sciences that centered around advanced\#engineering and top of the line technology.
Her taking interest in the academia did irk you a little bit. As\#if she had stepped into your territory.
Give in to jealousy and try to outdo her in science
Stick to botanism
You decided to not give your sister the satisfaction of being the\#booksmarts of the family. You snagged her books and tried to catch\#up to her level.
Unfortunately you had no natural knack for the subject and had to\#force yourself to concentrate.
Ultimately you did learn \c[2]Short circuit\c[0]!
One night your sister noticed you reading through her books.\#You were afraid of her reaction. Instead she tried to help you\#understand the charts and diagrams better.
Noticing the stark difference between the two of you, you decided to\#give up on the subject and got back to studying botanism.
Getting back to the natural world felt like a relief and you\#realized that's what you were born to do in this world.
You decided to concentrate on your own doings instead of giving in\#to the jealousy and it quickly beared fruit.
You learned \c[2]Undergrowth awareness\c[0]!
While occupying yourself with the world of botanism, your sister\#would often quietly join your reading sessions burying herself\#into her own books.
Despite your differences, these reading sessions really created a\#strong bond between the two of you.
During your highschool years a disaster struck. You suffered\#multiple small strokes in a short period of time and was left\#bedridden. Naturally you were terrified by what could have been\#causing this.
Your parents first turned to religious healers for aid, but\#nothing seemed to work. Your sister tried to persuade them to seek\#out modern doctors, but your parents were slow to react to her\#pleads.
After getting no results your parents finally gave in, but it was\#too late at that point. The diagnosis was that you had an abnormality\#of the spinal cord that affected the blood flow and its supply.
You underwent a long operation in hopes of fixing the issue, but\#unfortunately things didn't go well and you were bound for\#wheelchair for the unseeable future. If something had been done\#sooner, maybe things could've been different...
What followed was an intense period during which you tried many\#different medical treatments, all for nothing. There was no\#escaping the wheelchair. Your legs did have some minor function,\#but they were left far too weak to carry your weight properly.
The world felt like such an unfair and hostile place after all you\#had gone through.
All this just further created contrast between you and your sister.\#You couldn't help but be envious of her. Her life seemed to roll\#forward without hiccups of any kind whereas you struggled with each\#step you took quite literally.
Nevertheless, the two of you continued if not on the same path,\#then on the same lane at the very least as you both entered the\#same university in Bremen.
Naturally you were studying botanism and natural sciences and\#your sister studied new computer sciences and engineering.
You both were tremendously relieved. You had finally moved out\#of your parents' sphere of influence.
Like always, you and Reila were the polar opposites. Why would\#have things been any different in the university?
You had trouble getting acquainted with other students, but your\#sister on the other hand was already leading the student council and\#was even getting very familiar with one of the university professors.
Try to steal the affection of the professor
Just concentrate in your own studies
Expose the professor to his superiors
Seeing how Reila and your professor exchanged looks made jealously\#rear its ugly head once again.
Not giving the two a chance to meet up, you insisted that the\#professor would come for a dinner with you. You had some important\#things to discuss...
The professor, while a little confused, did accept to your invitation.\#The only problem was that you had never cooked in your life. Lucky\#you had the university library at your disposal.
You get \c[2]Recipes of the 15th Century\c[0]!
But alas, your social skills being what they were, nothing came out\#of it. It seemed like the professor and your sister were destined\#to end up together.
You learned \c[2]Advanced botanism\c[0]!
Just as you expected, your sister and the professor had an obvious\#connection. You were not sure whether you felt jealous for the fact\#that your sister garnered the attention from the opposite sex or\#that someone else was forming a connection with her.
Either way, you didn't think too much about it. It wasn't all bad\#anyway as you made good friends with the professor through your\#sister.
Your student life continued smoothly, you were constantly ranked\#top of your class and the nature seemed to lift its veil of secrets\#the further you got in your studies.
Your sister did even better at school. Apparently she was practically\#a genius in her field. She took part in a special student exchange\#program between the Bremen Empire and the Eastern Union.
She would get to see the world, while you were stuck on your\#laurels. Nothing new there you pondered.
In any case, the time had come for you to choose where you would\#specialize in your botanical studies.
Specialize in folkloristic side of botanism
Specialize in toxicology
You get the \c[2]Skin bible - Vinushka\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Toxicology\c[0]!
You graduated, started your own research in botanism while also\#working at the biggest greenhouse in Bremen. What should've been\#a brand new start in life felt more like you falling into place to\#gather moss. Living your life through your sister's amazing tales.
Her research abroad seemed to open many doors for her. The Eastern\#Union hired her to work in top secret facilities around the central\#Europa.
You would receive letters from her frequently, always from a\#different country. She could never fully reveal what she worked\#on, but she did say that despite working for the army, her inventions\#would be for the better of mankind, not for war.
It all sounded incredible and you were genuinely happy for her.\#Really. Only the letters came to a halt all of a sudden. You wouldn't\#hear from Reila for months.
After 6 months, your parents got information that Reila had been\#accused of treason. She had committed serious crimes against Bremen\#Empire. That's at least the official story. By the time you heard of\#this she had already been in an undisclosed Bremen prison for months.
You felt helpless. There wasn't much you could do. The next time you\#heard of her was when you read news about a terrorist group called\#'Nameless Liberty Underground' breaking her free from prison.
What had your sister gotten herself into? A terrorist organization?\#The news really bothered you. You had definitely heard of the\#'Nameless Liberty Underground' before. But where...?
Then you remembered it. The professor Reila had been seeing during\#her school years had mentioned the organization in a passing\#comment.
You investigated where the professor had gone after getting fired\#from the university only to find out that he had been executed\#several months prior. He too had been accused of treason and had\#been sentenced to be hanged in the middle of a battlefield.
Something weird was definitely going on.
You returned to the university to confront the professor. Only to\#find out that he had been executed several months prior. He too\#had been accused of treason and had been sentenced to be hanged in\#the middle of a battlefield.
You got to search through his office and found several letters from\#Reila. Apparently the two had been in a letter correspondence long\#after Reila had graduated.
In the last letter from her, Reila had cryptic writings about 'a cube'.\#Eastern Union had been 'desperately trying to replicate the cube, but\#to no avail'. Whatever that meant.
Reila was worried that 'the operation in Prehevil' was what Kaiser\#of Bremen Empire was after. 'There is still time before he could\#get here. I still have time.' Those were Reila's last words.
Upon further investigation you found out that Prehevil was a medium\#sized city in the country of Bohemia. That is the last known location\#of your sister. And that is where you decided to head without delay.
With a real adventure ahead of you, how did you prepare for the\#trip?
Find something to read for your travels
Stock up on herbs
You managed to find the \c[2]Alchemillia vol.1\c[0]!
You managed to find 2 \c[2]Green herbs\c[0], 2 \c[2]Blue herbs\c[0],\#2 \c[2]Lavenders\c[0] and a \c[2]Red herb\c[0]!
Was that... your sister?
An empty barrel.
The hallway is blocked by these chairs...
You could use the \c[2]Manor key\c[0] here?

\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"One can only wonder what happened to the folks around these\#parts..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"They've drifted far from humanity. Only thing they seem\#interested in is scavenging the scraps around the old town."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"How am I to have in-depth discussions with them? I want to\#talk about poetry, music... and culinary arts..."
"What happened here?"
"You don't seem so normal yourself either..."

"Your antlers for starters..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"You make no sense."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"You don't come barging in to other folk's houses and call\#them weirdos."

\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Use your imagination..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Food can be as inspiring as the highest forms of painted art\#or the most complicated musical arrangements..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"What comes to your mind when you look at these\#dangling beauties?"
"Meatballs."
"Kidneys."
"Embryos."
"Cotton candy."
"Duality of the mind."
"They look disgusting!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Meatballs... Surely you have never visited Prehevil before."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Such common courses are not dealt around these parts..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I understand where you're coming from... But you don't need\#to look at them so literally..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"The beginning and the end of life... I like your way of\#thinking..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"They sure don't taste like cotton candy..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I wonder if such salty treats are going to waste with the\#likes of you..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Now you're just showing off... What the hell is that supposed\#to even mean?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Are you even taking this seriously?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Do not insult the heritage of the Prehevil... This is their\#culture..."

\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Let's see... Yes..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"What about this little squirmy thing... What\#comes to your mind?"
"Local sausage."
"Snakes."
"Male genitalia."
"I dare not say..."
"Your antlers."
"Get that thing off my face!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"In a way, yes... It requires extra-ordinary amounts of time\#to cook."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"However, boil it for too long and it will be too chewy..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Slithering on the ground... Yes... The deceiving one..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Such vulgar talk! On my dinner table!"

\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I get a feeling you are not enjoying this dinner..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"But to refuse the delicacies... I spent all day making this\#special meal..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"This one is my favourite..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"This peculiar fungus... What is the first thing\#that comes to your mind?"
"Just an ordinary mushroom."
"Nudity."
"Family."
"Rainy day."
"Coitus."
"I've had enough!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"There is nothing ordinary in my cookings!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Goddammit! You are not even tasting the food! How can you\#insult the food without tasting it?!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"The surface of the mushroom is as silky as the butt cheeks\#of a virgin, yes."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"... We do not talk about family on this table..."
The atmosphere on the table became very cold suddenly.
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Mm... I can see that. You can still smell the damp forest\#floor..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"What kind of dirty mind do you possess?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"You've had enough when I say so!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Hmm... I don't know about you... But I'm full."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I thank you for the company."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"From what I understand... You are needed in the city..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I do have the key, however... I have one last question..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Do you support the Bremen army? Are you A Man O' Kaiser so\#to speak?"
"I don't know what you are talking about."
"I support the Bremen army."
"I fight against the Bremen army."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"You truly are a newcomer..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I'm afraid you are not the kind I was hoping for..." (M)
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"I'm afraid you are not the kind I was hoping for..." (F)
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Ha ha... Yes..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"You have my support..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Here... the key is yours..."
You get the \c[2]Lion brass key\c[0]!
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"The other key is with the army I'm afraid..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Please be discreet... I do not wish to start trouble with\#the Kaiser..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Do not mention my part in this."
You find the \c[2]Lion brass key\c[0]!
You find the \c[2]Manor key\c[0]!
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"The sleepy one!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"We meet again."
"How's it going?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Oh, you know, just hanging around."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"In a locked room."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Being all kidnapped and stuff."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Not too shabby."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Locked up in a fancy room."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"You know, just a normal tuesday kidnapping."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"But enough about me. How are you doing?"
"Who locked you here?"
"I'm doing alright."
"Struggling to be honest..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"The so-called 'Mayor of the Old Town'... But you just know that's\#bullshit."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"He's a newcomer just as we."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Something very messed up has happened to him."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"A random decrepit priest dragged me by my hair and locked me up here.\#I just went to ask something from him and he attacked me."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"He was spouting some nonsense about ritual crucifixion... I didn't\#especially like the sound of that."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"He looked off. Something very messed up had happened to him."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Something very messed up has happened to everyone in this town!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I don't get it... This is my hometown... It surely wasn't this\#bad when I last saw the place."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"It has always had its fair share of creeps and religious zealots,\#but this is a new high. Or new low, however you want to put it."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"That's nice. Surprising even. To be honest, I haven't gotten the\#nicest welcoming party..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"There is something very wrong about this place..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Yeaah... Feels bad man."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I think... It's time to pack our bags for good."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Do you mind if I stick with you for now?"
"Not at all."
"Sorry, I got other plans..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Nice."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Oh."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Well..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Well I suppose I can manage on my own too."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Take care sleepy one."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Seeing as you guys got it all cozy in that big party of yours..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I'll be going now."
There is a ladder to downstairs here...
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"My master is waiting for you at the dining room."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"Proceed upstairs, if you will. Turn left and then to your\#right."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"Please do mind your manners. It would be advised not to\#mention master's antlers for example."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"Good afternoon miss."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"Good afternoon mister."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"From what I understand, you are a newcomer to this town too, no?"
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"We just got a new mayor to the old town. I am sure he is thrilled\#to start his business immediately by meeting the newcomers."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"Please, he is waiting at the dining room."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"Proceed upstairs, if you will. Turn to your left and then to your\#right."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\#"I hope you had the most pleasant meal."
There is a towering waiter greeting here.
Looks like there's someone's seat here...
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Newcomer..." (M)
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"Newcomer..." (F)
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"So you've decided to play by their rules!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\#"This is how you repay my kindness!?"
The hallways seems to be blocked here...
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"For Alll-mer's sake!!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"You startled me!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Don't go sneaking up on me like that kid!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Don't go sneaking up on me like that doc!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"I'm always happy to see your glorious figure love, but give me\#a little warning next time, alright?"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Don't go sneaking up on me like that!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Now if you'd excuse me..."
You unlocked the doorway.
The priest is fixated on the pearl. He seems to be completely oblivious\#of you...
"What's so special about the pearl?"
\>\i[67]\}ECREPIT PRIEST\{\<\#"..."
You took the \c[2]Priest's head\c[0] as a trophy!
The hole looks too tight to climb through, but you are wondering\#where the roots of this pale tree go...
The bed looks comfy and relatively clean...
You feel strong killing intent through your sleep...
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Time to wake up you piece of shit!"
You recognize the person.
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"We are now finally going to have a little one-to-one."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Talk."
"What do you want?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"What do I want!? Rich. Very rich."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Who sent you?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Is it Accardo!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You're one of Accardo's fucking soldiers! I recognized your ugly\#ass mutt face the moment you came walking from the train cabin!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Didn't have balls to act right there in front of all the people?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Fucking pussy! Pussy full of maggots!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You got some nerve!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"What's the matter!? I need to beat some sense to you before you\#open that little mouth of yours!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"GODDAMNIT!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"WHO SENT YOU!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Accardo!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"One wrong move, one wrong word and you're a goner!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Start talking!"
"No one sent me here, I'm not doing Family errands here!"
"You wouldn't believe me anyway..."
"Why would someone send me after you?"
"I don't know what you are talking about..."
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"As if."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"BULLSHIT!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"The world just happens to be small enough for us to run into\#each other out here in the middle of - goddamn - nowhere!?"
"Yes. That's right."
"I don't know what to say, that's the truth..."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"This funny to you?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Nothing swipes a smile off someone's face like a lead pipe!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I'll ask once more. ONCE MORE!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"BULL - FUCKIN' - SHIT!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I don't know what's your plan here, but this ain't it chief."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"This will only get your skull smashed in."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You should know this well enough."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"So, once more... But only once."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I got no humour for this."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Well you got shit to lose at this point!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Talk!"
"I abandoned The Family. I'm running away from Vatican."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"That so?"
Caligura is measuring your words and looking intensely in your\#eyes...
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"You don't say...? Is this guy shitting me?"\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"A fucking pussy. That's what you are!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Family life's too hard for you?"
Caligura looks to be thinking what to do next.
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"He does look genuine..."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Why this place!? Why'd you come to this shithole out of all the\#places in the world!?"
"No reason. Just took the first train that departed Vatican."
"Why are you here?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Dumb fuck."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You really are as dim-witted as you look."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You think I'd believe that for a second!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Better come up with better excuses."
"I told you the truth."
"Fine, you got me. Accardo sent me."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Now what am I supposed to do with you?"
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Maybe he really isn't after me...?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Look at this ugly fuck... Shit..."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I'll be keeping my eye on you."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You better remember where your loyalties lie. I spared your ass\#right here and now."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"That doesn't happen often. Consider yourself among the lucky ones."
Caligura is trying to measure the honesty of your words...
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"This guy... That was an obvious lie. I can tell that much."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"FUCK! SHIT! FUCK!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I can see a mile away you're just pulling that shit out of your ass!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"So you're not here because of The Family..."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"FUCK!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"The storytime's over!? Fine!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You ain't asking the questions here!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"You really that desperate getting closely acquainted with this\#pipe of mine?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Why did you come here!? WHY THIS PLACE!?"
"I just took the first train that left from the Vatican."
"Must have been my rotten luck that got me here..."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Got that right."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"The same luck that ended up getting you killed here!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"That's none of your concern! I'd be more concerned of your own\#well-being if I were you."
"I probably got people after me as well. I ran away from The Family..."
"No. You answer my question. Who did you piss off?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Cut the bullshit!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I've seen you before. I remember your faggot-ass. You were dallying\#with one of my soldiers. Who was that...?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Whatever. Doesn't matter. I got him killed the morning after."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"Let's try this again."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"This how it's going to be?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\#"I'll ask once more."
You are not going to sleep in the presence of these remains and\#gore.
You are not going to sleep in the same bed with the corpse of this\#monster.
The tableware is just collecting dust here. Looks like these\#haven't been used in ages.
The cupboard is almost empty. There are only few small coins\#inside it.
You find 2 \c[2]Shillings\c[0]!
The cupboard is empty.
Books about economy and leadership. They're not going to\#help you now.
You can see city of Phehevil hidden behind the thick mist.
The cupboard holds nothing of value.
It's a crucifix of Alll-mer. The statue's expression is that\#of vengeance and rage.
Someone forgot their tea here. It's gone bad long ago...
The wardrobe stores linen and bed sheets.
The shelf has miscellaneous bottles and jars. Seems like\#this room has been used for rituals of some sort.
The cupboards and shelves got nice and decorated tableware.
There are some cleaning equipment stored here. They are no\#use for you.
From afar the statue looked convincing and nice, but upon a closer\#look, it's pretty crude.
A pile of random books. None of them catch your interest.
Looks like someone has violently vomited their guts out here\#and missed the tray.
... That's at least what it looks like.
An empty bucket.
Vials and bottles that seem to contain detergent and washing\#agent. They are no use for you.
Books about varying subjects.
A pile of books. They seem to be in bad shape. Could this\#possibly be a "throw-away pile"?
The walls are covered with paintings. Backdrops, portraits\#and abstact pictures. Melancholy seems to be the only thing\#they have in common.
17th century poetry is left here open. The language has changed\#a great deal since then and you don't bother seeing the effort\#right now.
The reinforced door is locked tightly.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Hey..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"That guy who locked me up is just behind that corner..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I.. I can't go there."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I just can't. As simple as that."
"You can wait here."
"Okay, let's not go there."
"Why not?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Okay... I'll be at the doorway over there."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Watch out for that guy..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Good."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Eeh... He is a major creep. And I got no plans to get locked up\#again."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I'll be at the doorway over there."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I hate him. As simple as that."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Hey sleepy one."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Done here?"
Old newspapers are scattered all over the place.
Random selection of books are left here. None of them catch\#your interest.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Let's just say good bye to this place already! This place gives me\#the creeps!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Back here, huh?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Not a fan."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I wonder what would've happened to me if you didn't get me out..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"So this is the mayor's manor"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I wonder if the mayor was aware of the shit happening in this town?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"We might find some clues if we ransack his office."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"It's pretty impressive house inside and out..."

The books have been neglected entirely. They are in too bad\#condition.
A lone Alll-mer crucifix hangs on the wall.
It's misty outside... It seem to get even thicker than before.
The lock of the briefcase seems to be broken and jammed.
An empty bucket with some spit stains here and there.
A metal crate that is sealed shut.

With some effort you are able to chip away some of the\#\c[2]Black matter\c[0] with you.
The sink has rusted shut long time ago. But it hasn't stopped\#people from using it.
The refridgerator is leaking dirty water...
Various different vials and bottles are stored here. They\#all seem grimy and useless to you.
An empty pot.
There's a ritual circle carved here. With chalk you could\#draw something here...
Written in blood: "Arm yourself. The Festival of Termina,\#the festival of blood is upon us!"

O'saa seems to be observing his surroundings.
Nothing left in the ammo case.
No reaction. The kicks seem to sink deep, the husk of the\#creature has become soft and floppy.
It's as if life has escaped the body.
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The creature's body feels hollow. It feels like a half-empty\#bag of potatos, with the potatos halfway through decomposing."

.\|.\|.\|\#You cannot seem to summon a soul that would belong to this husk.\#Either the creature never had one or your necromancy is simply\#not good enough.
Looks like a bottomless pit. Only a rancid reek eminates from the\#darkness.
It's a soft spot of dirt. It smells awful.

Teachings of Alll-mer are written on the bible...
"Eye for an eyes leads to everyone being blind. But when everyone\#involved is blind already, there is very little to lose."
"Blind in your quest for power? I am blind in my quest for\#vengeance."

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"What a miserable place it really is..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Why did we come here again?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"O' lord - get - me - as far away from here as possible."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"This is how you pray for him, right?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Hee, you got it right."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"But nothing happened."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"That's between you and our lord, I guess your relationship isn't\#on the best foundation."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Sheesh..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Not a fan of this place?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Gods, religion and me don't go well together."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Why's that? Many find salvation in religion."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"But there's always a cost."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Maybe it's in the small print but the cost is always there. You\#get nothing free."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"If you want something, work towards it yourself. Don't wait for\#gods or other powers to make their magic happen."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The biggest life lesson I had as a kid was 'the world doesn't\#owe you a goddamn thing'."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"If your happiness relies on the shoulders of others, then you're\#screwed."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Someone clearly got commitment issues."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I'm guessing you're not a devout believer?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Why's that?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"There's always a cost."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"It's a beautiful chapel..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"It's a bit eerie though, isn't it?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"There's something creepy about old churches. Especially when they\#are empty like this."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"A church of Alll-mer - the ascended one..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"Or at least coulisse of such."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Why do you say 'coulisse'?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It's not Alll-mer's traces that I sense here."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"Oh no, the decrepit priests of Prehevil spilled their blood for\#something much sinister."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Uh, what? What are you talking about?!"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"I'm not certain."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"But Alll-mer it is not. That much I can say."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Father... what on earth was going on here...?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"Do you know what they say of Alll-mer in Abyssonia, my home\#country?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"He was just a one more fool trying to fly too close to the sun\#in the mankind's endless pursuit for power."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"The people of Abyssonia don't see the need to reach for the sun.\#The sun is already harsh, merciless and too close for comfort."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"Mankind's true place is to dwell in primordial chaos from where\#it originally srpung from."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Pretty decent sized church..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"It's not quite the Cathedral of Shadows of the Vatican but it's\#got character of its own."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You visit churches often Marcoh?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Not any more than your usual penitent church-going-folk..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I do pray for Alll-mer from time to time."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"But that's to be expected, right?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Mm. I guess so..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"You do pray for Alll-mer too, don't you?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I didn't really have a religious upbringing..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Oh. You're one of those... 'atheists' then? That's the correct\#term?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I wouldn't say that either."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I think religion has its place. It obviously can help some when\#they need it the most..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"For me... I like the traditional aspect of it."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Religious practises can bring festivity to even more mundane of\#events."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I couldn't imagine funerals and weddings without the traditions\#that originate from religious practises."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I just like all that... More than actually dedicating my life\#to any one god."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"So I'm definitely not against religion. The opposite in fact.\#I just have my own relationship with it. If that makes sense."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"It does."
The chandelier has crashed through the ceiling... There doesn't\#appear to be a way back up...
The cell is locked with a simple rusty lock...
You could use the \c[2]Church keys\c[0] here?

Looks like this bucket was once used as a toilet for the\#prisoners here...
There is a rusty lever here...
Pull it
There's only cremated ashes and bone fragments in the urn...
Use the elevator?
Looks like someone was dragged out of the cell...
There is some writing on the papers...
"Whose laughing now? Whose laughing now I ask? I found the\#safest place in this rotten town."
"Whose the stupid one now?"
"I hear them at night... They slither the dark corridors."
"We are just sacrificial lambs to them. Waiting for slaughter."
There is nothing to devour...
There isn't much to kick. Only a sack of clothing and the\#empty shell left behind by the crimson father.
There is nothing to lay your seed in...
There is nothing to saw off...
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\#"This place... It's cursed."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\#"From the darkness of the night, they come..."
"Who are 'they?'"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\#"Curiosity will only get you killed. Just run away while\#you still can!"
A badly mutilated corpse. He seems to have been dead for a\#good while...
The body has been dismembered by something that you cannot\#quite tell. There are many whip marks across the body.
The dead man has got something bulging in his pocket...
Feel it out
Leave it be
You find \c[2]Church keys\c[0]!
GabText Sounds like the chandelier broke through the ground...
This chains seems to keep the chandelier hanging...
The galvanised chain seems tough and durable You'll need\#some serious leverage to cut it.
The body of the pillarman is incredibly sturdy. Seems like the\#thing is all muscle.
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I'm not entirely sure what has caused this man to grow this huge.\#He is humongous in every sense of the word. Except for where it\#counts. His muscles are almost bursting out from the torso."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The skin is peeled from the top of his head and nailed on the\#chest and back to expose the disfigured head that is shaped\#like an anvil. The exposed skull even feels as thick as one."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The man doesn't suffer from similar malformations and burns as\#the people outside. His skin is very pale in fact. Almost like\#he hasn't seen sun in years."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The pillarman has no particular weaknesses other than otherwordly\#powers having an increased effect on him."

There is rope tied on the beam...
Untie the rope
There appears to be a body of a woman in a wedding dress\#hanging at the end of the rope.
There is something shining on her hand...
GabText You didn't even realize how tall the church really was...
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Ah... I-I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go here..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Wheelchairs were not made for this..."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"W-why are we stopping!!?"

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"None of your business!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"You're the one who should be afraid! I wouldn't bet on your depth\#perception with that eyepatch of yours!"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Hey no reason to be mean."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Just don't look down. Imagine the beams are only a couple of meters\#high."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Is this necessary?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"If we're ambushed here, we're done."
Levi is walking on the beams pretty casually. The heights don't\#seem to be a problem for him.
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#*Yawn*
O'saa looks bored.
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"You can hold my hand if it's any help."
GabText The pillarman is shot down!
GabText The pillarman doesn't even flinch from the shot!
GabText The trenchgun destroys the chain!
You cannot penetrate the head to plant your seed. The head is\#too hard.
There appears to be a body of a man hanging at the end of the\#rope.
The man is long dead. You can tell by the stench alone.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"W-why are we stopping!"
There is an ornament crucifix stuck on the wooden beam...
You take the \c[2]Sabbath\c[0]!
A huge ritual circle is carved here. It doesn't seem to react\#to your presence...
You read her mind...\#\c[1]"I-I-I can't believe it happened..."\c[0]

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I've never seen it myself before, but I've heard of such magic\#practiced by some old-school dark priests."

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"A fitting end for such a spineless piece of shit......."
This thing is supposedly your father...
You've never seen it yourself before, but you've heard of such\#magic practiced by dark priests of the olden times.
They would bind themself to a building, an area or an item in\#order to prolong their existence.
The fact that he had created that bind already... That means he\#must have been dead already.
Only living through this church...
It does have a striking resemblance to him, so it must be true.
A wave of emotions rushes through you.
You feel sadness...
Nostalgia...
Pity...
Frustration...
Disbelief...
Anger...
Disgust...
Hatred...
Arrogance...
Guilt.

She is dead now...
No reaction, the body feels surprisingly sturdy.
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"... What is this even supposed to be?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The skin has gone through some kind of a metamorphosis. It's very\#thick and sturdy. Almost gives her an armor of sorts..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The head... It's her face, only peeled open. Charming."
Her body has gone through some kind of a metamorphosis. The skin\#feels thick and sturdy. It's almost armor-like.
Her head has been peeled open. The skin is stretched on the rim\#that goes around her head.
She has nothing of value.
The skin is too thick for your teeth to sink in.
The skin is too thick for you to penetrate it.
You took the \c[2]Dysmorphia head\c[0] as a trophy!
A formless pillar of human flesh...
A seemingly bottmless pit. A smell of rot is eminating from\#the depths...
A pillar of clay...
Mold it
You made an idol of yourself.
It looks good, even if you say it yourself.

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I doubt science is able to answer what is going on here..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"This appears to be a perversion of the church."

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"How do you fight back against something you cannot understand?"
The gate is locked with a simple lock...
There is a person, or being buried under the chains.
The chains have some kinds of sigils etched all over them...
Use the \c[2]Rusty key\c[0]
Try to open the chains
The chains won't budge.
They seem to be kept in place by a rusty padlock that has similar\#sigils carved into it as the chains have.
The being is gone...
All that is left are the chains and the padlock.
You pick up the \c[2]Heart-shaped lock\c[0]!
Only the chains remain.

\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"Humanity and their endless yerning..."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"I stood next to your celebrated christ, Alll-mer the Ascended One\#as he carved his idol."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"To condense his true essence, he carved that macabre being from\#the depths of his sub-consciousness."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"To confront his shadow, the unknowable, the 'imperfection' that\#obstructed his pursuits of absolution."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"As one, the 'ascended one' became two - That was when humanity\#finally reached the heights it had always strived for."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"Only it was not two gods that the mankind yearned for, now was it?"
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"If the other one had been dug deep within Alll-mer's\#sub-consciousness, it had to be sent back just as deep so it wouldn't\#obstruct the newfound order."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"Cast away, so that true absolution could be reached. Cast away\#deep, all the way down to the sulfuric pits."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"But which one was it that got cast away? The conscious or the\#sub-conscious of the ascended one?"
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"If you continue carving idols, big enough to rival the old world\#order - You won't know which side of you prevails."
\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\#"It could just as well be you who gets squashed as your shadow runs\#loose."
Use the \c[2]Lighter\c[0] to light the bonfire?

There is a bonfire piled up here...
The flickering light of the bonfire soothes you despite the\#horrors waiting you outside...
It's too dark down there. You cannot see anything but darkness.
You cannot hear or see anything down there.

"I'll see what I can do."
\>\i[85]\}RETCHED BEING\{\<\#"The woodsman..."

You got the \c[2]Shield of the Four\c[0].
\>\i[85]\}RETCHED BEING\{\<\#"You still got a head on those shoulders..."
A wall of severed heads. The heads seem to be in varying\#states of rot.
The earliest heads look like several weeks old, while the\#most recent ones seem to be freshly cut.
Dirty dishes and leftovers. Considering the place, you're not\#entirely sure what's the origin of fleshy meat...
A sealed metal crate left here to gather rust.
The person is barely alive. You can already hear death rattle\#coming from him...
Finish him
Loot him
He is dead now.
He is dead now...

"I don't need new acquaintances."
\>\i[76]\}AN WITH CHECKERED PANTS\{\<\#"Pleasure."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"My mother called me Daan and my father called me Daniël, so it's\#anyone's guess which one is the real name."

This is a big crate. You can really open it without better\#tools...
A bloody bowl. The blood is all dried up.
There is someone's diary on the floor.
"I feel the rope tightening around my neck with each passing day.\#The city has always been narrow-minded and bigoted. If you didn't\#follow the doctrine to a t, you'd be persecuted to no end."
"The priests don't encourage this behiour with words, but they don't\#have to. The centuries of inbreeding and inward looking has created\#an atmosphere where there is no room for deviation, let alone\#criticism."
"The mob mentality takes over the town at regular intervals and\#the gallows become familiar to every nonconformist."
"I've seen this happen time and time again, yet for some reason\#I never imagined becoming the next in line to go."
"So here we are now. I saw the signs. I'll prepare for my leave.\#In the meantime I take temporary shelter at these outskirts."
"The moon is awfully high tonight. I hear noises echo from the\#heart of the city... The mob gathered around that hollow tower..."
"The high priest will have his speech there... I fear that I\#lingered for too long... I should've left the city years ago\#already."
You take the \c[2]Film reel\c[0].
Looks like someone has gathered all of the possession here.
You find nothing useful.
There is a portrait of a young man on the table. The person has his\#face scrather over.

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I was thinking that these tunnels could be a possible mission silo,\#or a construct for some other kind of weapon..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"But I haven't seen any evidence that would support that theory. At\#least not yet."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"What could this place be? Such a strange place for a tunnel like\#this..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I'm sorry if I'm just slowing you down..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Another tunnel? There's something more to these things I'm sure."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"These tunnels go surprisingly far. It's almost as if there is a\#whole network of these things underground."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Yep. This bunker definitely wasn't here before."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"It's crazy to think that all this exists under Prehevil..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"I would've known if something like this was being made under our\#feet when I was a kid."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"I wonder... How new are these tunnels really?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"These tunnels were obviously made for military purposes... But what\#those purposes really are? I guess we'll have to wait and see."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Don't let all this bad luck get to you. No amount of bad luck should\#stop you from pursuing your dreams."

The sarcofagus looks hundreds of years old. It must be close to\#as old as this church.
The stone slab cover doesn't seem to budge. Either it's heavier than\#what it looks like or there is a mechanism keeping it in place.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I guess we need to check up on that girl..."
Karin unlocked the cell door with her lockpicking skills.
GabText The air is filled with the absolutely disgusting scent of gore!
It's a crucifix of Alll-mer. The statue's expression is that of\#vengeance and rage.
The statue of a winged being seems to be holding something...
Reach out and grab it
You take the \c[2]Martyr effigy\c[0]!
You cannot quite explain why, but the small statuette feels to hold\#great importance...
It's a statue of a winged being.

A bucket full of filth.

\>\i[144]\}ILLARMAN\{\<\#"..."
The pillarman just stares at you...
A pool of blood... The blood looks relatively fresh...
You can see the silhouette of your reflection in the blood. It\#distorts beyond recognition.
A bucket full of grime.
Something's been written on the book...
"New gods?"
"What do you think happens if a monkey is given the power of a\#higher being? All it knows is to rape and devour everything on\#its path, just to survive."
There is writing of blood here...
"They came from the pools of blood."
"Oh yes I can read blood. I was born from it."
"The bloodshed attracts them."
There's a ritual circle carved here. If you had something to\#draw with, you could actually use it.
The cell is full of mutilated flesh...
The bucket is full of filth. It's hard to tell details of the\#filth.
A pale tree pushed through the ground and smashed a hole to the\#ceiling.

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"I'm getting bad vibes from this place."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Why does the church have dungeons?"
Levi looks tense, as if he's preparing for an encounter...
O'saa is facing away from you and talking to himself...
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Please do share. What's are you whispering O'saa?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"Do not stress your little head with that."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It is nothing of concern."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Looks pretty concerning to me."
"Who are you talking to?"
"You are not answering my question..."
"How is your mental state?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It is..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It is just a mantra I keep chanting. To ease my mind."

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"The air is really heavy down here..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I don't like it one bit."
A rusty metal bucket.
A grimy old bucket.
There's something hidden here in the darkness...
The hallway has been blocked by all this random junk.
An empty suitcase.
You find a \c[2]Crosswords puzzle\c[0]!
The view is almost straight through the windows of the\#neighbour. The residents of these buildings don't care much\#for the privacy...
A painting of a tranquil landscape. It's strange to see such\#peaceful scenery in the middle of all this chaos.
A painting of a gaunt figure. The picture depicts a young\#male with striking cheekbones.
Dirty laundry. The stains are there for good. No amount of\#scrubbing will clean these plates.
This must be the television room...
The entire room is focused on this television set.
Too bad it's useless because of the lack of electricity...
A bloody bowl... Typical to every television room.
The wardrobe doesn't seem to have anything useful in it.
No reaction, but you feel satisfaction with each kick.
No reaction, but it feels good to kick the boney body of the\#rifleman.

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"What's that, a television?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Looks like these people were into hoarding junk..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Do you notice it? The floor is slightly slanted towards the TV."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"How odd..."

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"It's a bit smelly here, isn't it? Smells like something was left\#in the oven for a bit too long..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I've never noticed it before, but you can see yourself pretty well\#from the dark screen of the television. It's almost like a mirror."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I don't even have claustrophobia or anything to that nature, but\#these jam-packed hallways raise my anxiety levels quite a lot."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Hard agree..."
Levi is quietly looking at the television screen. He looks to be\#lost in his thoughts.
"See anything interesting?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"Oh?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"It's nothing. Just my reflection on the TV..."
O'saa is transfixed with the television.
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"What a bizarre contraption this is."

GabText You wound the arm of the rifleman!
Someone had a lavish and grotesque dinner here...
Seems like someone has just recently emptied the refridgerator.
There's something on the bottom shelf though...
A plate of blood... It's all dried up now.
Flies are gathering around the gore that's left here...
The gore looks like it's been chopped into small pieces.\#Maybe someone made food from it?
The cash register seems untouched, despite all the chaos\#in the town...

An old wine barrel. It sounds hollow. There isn't any wine left\#anymore.
The shelves are full of different utility items.
The sink doesn't seem to work.
The pot lid is sticky and stuck... The stickiness transferred\#to your hands now...
The oven seems to be in pretty decent condition. Looks like\#someone has been taking good care of it.

\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"So yeah, it was the grand return of the prodigal son. Back to my\#folks I went."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Out of necessity - One's gotta get their money from somewhere,\#I got back into what I used to do as a lad with my parents, that's\#cooking meals at their tavern."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Turns out, I had a knack for that stuff. The tavern got famous.\#They even wrote an article about the place on the local paper."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"Maybe you've heard of it? It's called 'Klimkov's'."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"So I embraced the thing. I started learning more and more about\#culinary arts. Started travelling to find new inspiration..."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"And that got me here ultimately, but even in this situation I end\#up cooking. And the craziest thing is that I haven't been this\#inspired, like ever."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\#"I'm seeing new combinations in my head, my palette is expanding\#thanks to all the new local ingredients... Making food like it's\#the last day of my life."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"At least I am in normal situations. At the train I had to eat\#whatever we had at disposal..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Ok. Well no Bohemian food for you in that case. Someone or\#something had to die, preferably multiple times before it gets\#to the plate."

A dirty coffee cup...

This shelf is dedicated to modern drama. Many of the books\#center around people waiting for their loved ones to return\#from the battlefield.

This bookstore... This chair...
You used to sit on this chair as a child and read books hours on\#end...
The life was so much simpler back then...
This bookshelf has books about history and culture. None of\#the books catch your attention.
The shelf is full of autobiographies of the war veterans from\#the first great war.
These books are categorized as romance and drama. Many of\#them seem to have scenes of erotica in them as well.
These books are straight on erotica. Just one glimpse at the\#covers makes that perfectly clear.
The table has the newest additions to the book store. Many of\#the books are drama and fiction written in either Bremen or\#Rondon.
A random suspense novel has been set here. The tale tells about\#stormy waters northwest from the shores of Rondon.
Two brothers who established a fishing route on a particularly\#dangerous waters finally pushed their luck too far and were\#caught in a massive whirlwind.
Even if the subject doesn't especially interest you, the tale\#does get your heart racing and you can vividly imagine the\#monstrous whirlwind swallowing the brothers down to its bottomless\#depths...

An old-fashioned.
A dry martini.
A cosmopolitan.
A glass of milk.
You finish the drink.
Daan looks dead. He has foam coming from his mouth...
A glass of Old Vinland whiskey. Even before sipping\#from the finely decorated glass, the rich and deep\#aroma fills your nostrils. You wait for a brief second\#before taking the first sip.
The whiskey gives a small burning sensation on its way\#down, but still you savour the taste for as long as it\#lingers on the tip of your tongue.
A deep warmth fills your insides long after the glass\#is empty.
You rock the ice around the glass for a few times.\#The old fashioned settles down and you catch its\#scent that is a mix of both sweet and musky.
You taste the drink briefly to check out the exact\#ratio of its ingredients...
The whiskey (which seems to be on the more expensive\#side) is clearly the dominating flavour, but the\#sugar and the water help the drink roll off your\#tongue more easily.
You are pleased to notice that the herbal taste of\#the Angostura only hints with its presence afterwards,\#never trying to rival the key ingredients.
It soon becomes evident that this drink is perfectly\#mixed old fashioned. It has all the best qualities of\#a good whiskey but it's casual enough for you to drink\#it like a sailor.
You take a sip from the delicate glass, covered in\#slight frost. The ice cold drink creates a refreshing\#initial impression as the bitterness of the gin kicks\#you with its liquor taste.
Quickly vermouth in the drink takes over however\#as its sweetness becomes more dominant in the\#aftertaste.
The drink is doing a fine balancing act between being\#a 'dry martini' and 'wet martini'. Just a little bit\#more vermouth and you couldn't call the drink 'dry'\#anymore with good conscience.
Not that it's a complaint. The drink really is quite\#remarkable, wet or dry.
On your second sip you notice some of the finer\#nuances of the drink. The mild aftertaste of saline\#from the olives... And is that lemon zest you taste?
Before you know it, the small glass is empty and all\#you have left of the drink are the warm memories.
The blend of the cocktail looks immaculate. You\#have no doubts that the taste will be just as good\#as you raise the delicate glass on your lips...
The freshly squeezed lime presents the dominating\#sour flavour but it is balanced masterfully with\#the sweetness that comes from the triple sec. The\#liquor gives the drink sweet orange flavour.
The slight hint of cranberry juice in the background\#keeps your taste buds guessing as the vodka blends\#everything together by diluting the most powerful\#flavours.
The taste is fruity, refreshing and a perfect blend\#of sweet and sour. After few more sips you'd say\#that the orange-flavoured triple sec is the unsung\#hero of the cocktail.
The citrus punch really takes the drink to another\#level. The cosmo truly is a light drink. Dangerously\#so.
You can only tell there was a large amount of vodka\#in the drink from the slight fuzz in your head as\#you finish the drink.
You drink the milk. It's...\. well, it's just milk.\#It doesn't exactly inspire the poet inside you.

You read his mind...\#\c[1]"This day is supposedly the climax of The Festival..."\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Did I make a mistake in not participating...?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"No. Even if it kills me, I must hold on to what is right."\c[0]
You read his mind...\#\c[1]"Western bars don't differ that much from the ones we have\#in Edo..."\c[0]
Tanaka looks dead. He has foam coming from his mouth...
You search from under the piano... But there's nothing there.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"W-what? What do you mean nothing!?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Let me see!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"B-but... I hid it here. I swear I did!"
"Someone else must have taken it."
"This is not a good look for you..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"But you believe me right?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I didn't shoot that man for no reason!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Even I'm not that cold!"
"I believe you."
"I don't really care one way or another..."
Karin nods.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Good."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Even if I'm a journalist, I don't make bullshit like this up."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Who could've taken the journal?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Fair enough I guess..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"But I didn't make up that journal. It definitely existed."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I guess I'll have to prove myself some other way..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Fine. Whatever. I know the truth, that's all that matters."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I'm out of this dump."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"...?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I'd appreciate if you said anything."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Whatever. I know the truth, that's all that matters."
She's dead.
A partly charred body. There seems to be something hanging on his\#neck...
You find a \c[2]Soul devour necklace\c[0]!
The body has gone through intense physical trauma. Looks like he\#suffered from severe burns.
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"That is one tall statue!"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"A little intimidating, if I'm perfectly honest..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"The statue looks familiar... Is it an older god?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Why is it left in the darkness like this?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"It's the statue of Alll-mer. At least one depiction of the god."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"There used to be a large crack going through its forehead all the\#way to the chest, but looks like it has been fixed since I last\#saw it..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Pretty impressive sight..."
Levi is just staring at the giant statue with his mouth open.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I'm guessing you've never seen this before?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"No, never seen it..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"This altar was closed from the public back in the day. I'm not\#sure why."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"The statue is supposed to depict Alll-mer?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"What a bastardized version of him."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Yes, yes, the statue is impressive, but you're ignoring the\#elephant in the room - the sacrificial altar!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What the hell is going on in this town!?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What is this...? A huge sacrificial altar?"
You see multiple eyes glowing in the darkness above...
\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\#"You're not the one I'm after! Who are you!?"
\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\#"I see, I see. You're one those idiots."

\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\#"I'm off! I don't even bother tainting my blade with your foul blood!"
You picked up the \c[2]Sergal spear\c[0] from the severed hand of\#the sergal.
The doors are locked from the other side...
The books are growing together because of the white crust that is\#covering this entire building.
All the spare keys to the apartments appear to be here...
Among them you find the \c[2]Master key\c[0]!
GabText Quiet... All the sounds from outside are muffled by the thick walls.
A toolbox with random tools for everyday apartment maintenance.
A dirty bucket used for cleaning. The mop is sealed inside the bucket.\#You cannot get it out.
A dirty bucket used for cleaning.
A bucket that's been sealed shut. You can't quite tell what the\#bucket contains.
The boxes are used to store folders and papers, but everthing is\#covered in the same white crust so you cannot be 100% certain on\#the contents.
The boxes are used to store cleaning products, but everthing is\#covered in the same white crust so you cannot be 100% certain on\#the contents.

The faucet doesn't budge. It's stuck no matter how hard you try to\#wring it.
The cupboards only contain regular household items. Nothing of\#interest.
The window is sealed shut by the white crust that is covering\#seemingly everything in this building.
The television screen is filled with white noise once again.
You recognize yourself from the TV screen, yet you don't ever\#remember doing a broadcast like this in your life.
You are certain that you've never even visited this city before,\#so how can there be footage of you commentating a murder?
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"W-what is this...?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"This footage... That's me...?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"It can't be..."
"What's wrong?"
"What's the big deal?"
"I didn't see anything odd in there."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"This gives me some serious creeps..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What if I told that I've never done a broadcast like that?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Not only that, I've never even been to Prehevil before. There\#is no way this footage should exist."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What's the big deal!?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What if I told that I've never done a broadcast like that!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Hell, I've never even been to Prehevil before!"

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I've never done a broadcast like that!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Yet there I am... talking about a case I have no clue about."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"This makes no sense. Am I losing my mind here?"
"Maybe you've forgotten this?"
"Maybe it's a doppelgänger?"
"Nothing in this place makes sense."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Just how do you forget things like that?!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I'm sure about this..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"She even got my 'commentator' voice. My way of speaking when in\#front of a camera."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Let's just finish our business here and get out. The sooner the\#better."
Karin looks clearly distressed by this incident.
Watch television?
You can only see white noise...
No wait, there are shapes forming in the chaos...
Mail boxes for the apartment residents. They're covered with some\#kind of white crust that prevents their use.
Most of the text in the book is illegible but there is a one\#passage that you can make sense of...
"Only when I'm alone in here, during the late hours. Only then I\#notice the true nature of these hallways. The cracked floor tiles,\#decrepit toilets, the moldy planks that rise up to the endless\#heights."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What's wrong with this place...?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"...Anyone home...?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"It's so quiet here."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Like the whole house is in a deep sleep..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"This building... Something feels very off about this place..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"What is this mold...?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"It's covering everything..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I'm not sure if it's actually mold..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"The texture is unlike anything I've seen..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Rubbery and crusty at the same time."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Yes..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"This place... Do you feel dizzy too?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It's not natural for people to live in closed spaces like these."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Depends on the rent really..."
Marcoh is looking grim for some reason.
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"What's the matter Marcoh?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Nothing."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You look so grim?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I don't really like closed places..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"You've got a claustrophobia?"
Looks like the boiler hasn't seen use in a good while.
The washing machine started shaking the moment you got out. You can't\#climb back in as it is...
There is a washing machine standing here.
The glass screen is too filthy for you to see inside...
The insides are bloody and disgusting.
Upon further investigation you notice that the washing machine hole\#turns into a tunnel. You can see faint light out there in a short\#distance.
Crawl in
Empty.
The door is sealed shut by some sort of mold...
GabText Something reeks down here...
Moldy crates.
Moldy boxes.
The doorway is completely blocked by the boxes.
A sink that is covered with white crust from top to bottom.
The washing machine started shaking violently the moment you got out.\#You can't climb back in as it is...
The washing machine is shaking violently. There is a padlock with\#a mechanical 4-digit code keeping the lid closed.
Set a password
Force the washing machine open
The glass window is dirty with murky liquids foaming inside.
You don't see any laundry inside though. Occasional thump sounds\#suggest that there are some objects inside.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Ah. There must be additional safety locks inside. I can't seem\#to get this thing open..."
The door doesn't open. It must have additional safety locks inside.
You could use the \c[2]Master key\c[0] here?
The plant is covered with the white crust, similar to pretty much\#everything else in this apartment.
The door is sealed shut because of the mold-like growth...
The plant is covered in the white crust. It feel very delicate and\#dry because of that. It crumbles to dust if you even touch it gently.
The plants is covered in the white crust. It feel very delicate and\#dry because of that. It crumbles to dust if you even touch it gently.
The horsehead statue is in pieces now...
GabText The air is at a total standstill...

GabText The neighbour is shot down!
GabText You shoot the arm of the neighbour!
GabText You wound the arm of the neighbour!
The plants are covered in the white crust. They feel very delicate\#and dry because of that. They crumble to dust if you even touch them.
The wardrobe contains random clothing, all covered in white crust\#making them pretty much useless...
The matress seems to have been in heavy use in the past. Now it\#is laid to a white rest similar to the entire building.
There is a book on the floor with some erratic writing in it.
You find the \c[2]Diary of a madman\c[0].
There is a sigil of the Sulfur god on the floor.
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\#\c[7]"Sulfur god...? Now that's something I wasn't expecting."\c[0]
"What do you know about the sulfur god?"
"Should we be worried?"
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\#\c[7]"Not much. Probably the same as you at this point."\c[0]
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\#\c[7]"The thing was active way before my time, but he had already\#vanished from the face of the earth by the time I started learning\#about the greater scheme of things."\c[0]

There is an unknown sigil on the floor.

You became a permanent part of the sleeping house.
There is a moldy bed here... You could sleep and rest if you wanted\#to, although every alarm bell is ringing in your head when it comes\#to this apartment.
There is a portrait of a young man on the table. The person has his\#face scrathed over.
The lamp doesn't work. Or if it does, the light doesn't come through\#the white crust, so it's all the same.
The rotten floorboards gave in to the weight of the statue.\#Now there is a gaping hole to the darkness here...
It's dark down there. But by the looks of the rough shapes you can\#see, it should just be a similar apartment to this.
A horsehead statue stands proudly here. The statue doesn't seem too\#heavy. You could push it pretty easily...

The door is locked with a simple lock. There is handwriting on the\#door that says "Please do not disturb."

Karin unlocked the gate with her lockpicking skills.
A dirty bucket with dried murky mucus in the bottom.
It smells greasy and disgusting.

Between the books you find a note that says:\#"Someone stole the headmaster's ring. It must be found. Search\#the lockers and beds. Strip search the children if you have to."
The bulletin board has information about upcoming school events.\#All of the events date back over one month.
A rusty bucket. There's still some dirty water in the bottom.
A bucket left here to gather rust.
The boxes have miscellaneous school supplies and papers in them.
The cabinets contain documents of all the students and orphans\#that take residence here.
From a quick glance you can tell that the documents contain\#very intrusive information. It appears that none of the\#children have any privacy under this roof.
Someone's teeth are at the bottom of the bucket. They appear\#pretty small. They must be from one of the children living\#under this roof.

The smell of mold and traces of the flowery perfume the nuns used...
It's enough to get your stomach churning.
You never questioned it before, but how come some of the nuns used\#that perfume in the first place?
You don't know whether you should feel angry or sad remembering your\#father...
It's a painting of your father...
It's eerie how well the painting manages to portray the quiet\#menace he eminated...
A wide range of emotions go through your head...
A painting of a grumpy old man. Judging from the wrinkles on his\#face, he must have had that frown for all his life.
His eyes look glassy and more menacing than the rest of his expression...\#It's actually pretty creepy.

He has a gaping wound on the chest...

There is text detailing the origin of the eastern armor...
"A traditional body armor that was typically worn by the warrior\#class of Yansa Aryuaban. The cuirass consists individual leather\#and/or iron scales that are connected to each other with leather\#or silk lace depending on the era."
"The armor is a great example of the two cultures of Edo and\#Eastern Sanctuaries melting together."
"During the 8th century Eastern Sanctuaries led multiple campaigns\#against the Kingdom of Edo, but each proved out to be fruitless\#endeavours."
"The sultan of the Eastern Sanctuaries, Nas'hrah the Great did have\#certain respect for his adversary and acknowledged the warring arts\#of Edo that were highly developed in the isolation of an island\#nation."
"Since he was unable to make the warring arts his own by\#conquering the kingdom and forcing it under his rule,\#he instead formed a brand new country inside the borders of\#Eastern Sanctuaries."
"He appointed the high status war prisoners from Edo as the\#central figures of this new country and ordered them to mimic\#the ways of Edo as closely as possible and breed a warrior class\#for the eternal kingdom that was Eastern Sanctuaries."
"This didn't happen over night but rather took hundreds of years,\#but ultimately Eastern Sanctuaries did get what Nas'hrah wanted -\#The warrior class 'Jizamurai' was born in the Yansa Aryuaban."

There is a mysterious lamp on the table.
Rub it
You rubbed the lamp real good. It's polished now.
Sounds like there is something inside the lamp...
Try to shake the lamp
Let it be
Upon turning and shaking the lamp a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0] rolled out.
The lamp has faint ornament letters. You cannot recognize the\#language, but it reminds you of Eastern Sanctuaries.
The shelves are full of supposed occult items. Many of them look\#fraud to you though.
Some kind of alchemic furnace. Something has been burned here\#recently. The smell is that of old exotic spices.

Levi doesn't look interested.
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"What is this supposed to do...?
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Or that?"
Marcoh is awkwardly browsing through the magical items...

The barrel contains gore and some white substance. It reeks terrible!
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"One second we were at the school and now we're here."

It's too steep to climb up but you could jump down from here with\#ease though...
You could jump down from here.
Jump
What's this? There is something buried under the dirt...
You find 5 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0]!
The well doesn't look that deep from down here... But still...\#Can you actually get back up?
Yell for help
Investigate the walls
Knock on the walls
You try to yell for help as loud as possible.
Try again
Nothing... No one hears you scream.
You can't seem to get a good grip from the wall.
The stones are too round and the slippery moss doesn't help.
Things don't look good...
You try to find anything to help your situation... The cracks\#between the stones... Nothing...
Loose stones... Nope... Nothing.
The well doesn't look that deep from down here...
You can feel this realization in your guts. What if you can't get\#back up?
There is a rope here...
His head has been cut off...
You don't feel so lucky though for whatever reason...
You hear someone walk on the ground level...
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Hello...?"

Marcoh has quiet determination in his voice. For some reason you\#believe what he's saying.

You cannot penetrate the thick skull of the beast to lay down your\#seed.
No reaction from the beast. Your kicks probably wouldn't have much\#effect even if the thing was still alive...
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I mean... It's a big dog."

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Seems pretty stuck though, so can't examine it any closer..."
The beast seems to have the physique of a normal wolf, only ten\#times bigger, has three eyes, possibly four and a mouth full of\#sharp teeth.
There doesn't appear to be any signs of mutation. Could this beast\#have grown to this size on its own, naturally?
The sword - if you can even call it that - on its back is a\#curious thing. It looks almost organic... Like it's alive?

\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"This building had an effect on Marcoh. It woke buried memories of\#his. I had seen remorse in his eye from the beginning, but the deeper\#we got into this building, the more evident it became."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Ultimately it drove him into madness. I'm not sure what happened,\#but one moment Marcoh ran around the corner and the next that beast\#came bursting through a wall."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Just what does this city do to us?"

"It does make it easier, yes."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is a base mechanic of the human mind, to demonize those who\#oppose us."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"We can only inspect our actions in retrospective and wonder what\#we really saw at the time."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"At least you are honest in your words. Even if they speak of\#cruelty."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"A murder is a murder. Yes..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Well then..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Do you feel this killing was justified?"
"No..."
"It was self-defence..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Yet you are in a confessional?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"If you felt it was truly justified, would it be on your conscience\#still?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh yes, sorry about asking such silly questions..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You wouldn't be here if you felt otherwise."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Self-defence or not, you are in a confessional telling me about\#this event..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So surely you don't feel it being a justified slaughter?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"How did you feel afterwards? After the slaughter?"
"I didn't feel anything..."
"I felt ecstatic..."
"I felt remorse and guilt."
"I felt horny."
"I felt like killing myself."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It can be worrying to realize just how quickly we get used to\#killing."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"But then again the city is as it is, so I cannot blame you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It's not like my hands are entirely clean of blood either."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Ecstatic? Really?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That is vile."
"Aren't you supposed to be neutral?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"No, that was never part of the deal."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Alll-mer might not judge you, but I surely can, and will."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Are you sure about that?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"This is not just an act? An act of supposed normalcy in fear of\#the judging eye?"
"No, I really feel bad about it."
"What kind of question is that?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Hm. I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Well we'll see about that."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You know what they say about answering to a question with a\#question?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You are only lying to yourself here."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Silence speaks words."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh! Hahaha! Excuse my nervous laughter..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"...But that is just horribly messed up."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"This is the kind of dirt I wanted to hear when I signed up for\#this, but good man... That is just wrong."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Alll-mer most likely judges you too in this case."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"A life for a life?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"There is justice in that, but why did you only leave it at a\#thought? Why not act upon it?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Cowardice and idleness are among greater sins as well."
"Are you suggesting I kill myself!?"
"What kind of priest are you?"
"You are right..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I am not suggesting anything. You are the one who brought up this\#topic."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That is none of your concern, nor does it have anything to do\#with this topic."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Well let's move on."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Did your actions have consequences?"
"Nothing to speak of..."
"I was rewarded..."
"Everything has consequences in life."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So you got away with a murder?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That must be ideal to you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That must deepen your guilt even more..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You could view it as a second chance. If you wanted to be optimist\#about it."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh my. Mysterious are the ways of Alll-mer."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Now it is another question whether this reward will always remind\#you of this occurence or not."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Very true."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is not always you who has to live with the consequences though."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Now the important question is... Are you going to continue on\#this path of massacre, or was this just a single occurence?"
"I will kill again if I have to."
"I will try not to resort to this again..."
"I can't get enough of it."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Yes... It is good not to make empty promises."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Sounds like you have resolved your inner conflict by yourself."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"To absolve your sins, do a ritual sacrifice or two and you should\#be good."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"..And try to get good sleep, eat your vitamins and love your\#neighbour."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That is all."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"To absolve your sins, you would need to feel remorse, I do not\#think that is the case."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Just get out there and paint the streets red for all I care."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Yes, that is all we can truly do. To aspire for better."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Jumping straight to the juicy bits I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Good. Good..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Tell me, is he or she one of your fellow people from the train?"
"Yes. How did you know?"
"No, someone else entirely."
"I rather keep this anonymous."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Interesting..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Does she have a red hair?"
"Yes! How did you know?"
"It's not 'she'."
"This is getting uncomfortable..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I see. I see..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"My apologies. I didn't mean to assume things."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Does she have a light hair?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"No?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Hm. Is that so?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Where did you get acquainted with this person then?"
"At school..."
"At work..."
"The person is a relative..."
"Through a friend of mine..."
"Just a random person."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Shared experience and shared growth is fertile grounds for affection.\#It is only normal to grow feelings for your peers."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Is that so...?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh yes... I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Interesting."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Fair enough."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Do you think this person has mutual feelings?"
"I don't know."
"I'd hope so..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That can be gut-wrenching. I'm sure everyone of us can relate to\#that feeling."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Actually no... Now that I think about it, I have never been\#rejected."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Well I have a vivid imagination, so I can imagine what you are\#going through."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So could this be forbidden love?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Very interesting."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So you've kept your feelings hidden?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"One can hope, and in hope it is good to live..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So let us cut to the chase - Why is this lust condemned? Or\#why do you feel it is not appropriate?"
"The person is with someone else..."
"The society condemns our relationship."
"I do not deserve the affection of the person."
"The person is a close relative of mine."
"To lust is to sin."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It wouldn't happen to be with this 'friend' you mentioned earlier?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That does complicate things quite a bit..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh, that does complicate things..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"But the person answers to your affection, so am I wrong in assuming\#that you do not want to hurt this third wheel in this tale?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It sounds like a difficult scenario."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Ahh..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Are you sure about this? Sometimes people can be more open than\#what the old taboos would lead you to believe."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Of course sometimes people can act out of fear of the unknown and\#condemn everything that is alien to them."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"And... sometimes you're the one who is wrong. Not all things should\#be experimented with. And not all taboos need to be pushed."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You won't know what is the case, before you proclaim your love\#out in the public."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Maybe your problems don't lie in the lustful thoughts after all..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is your self-confidence that sounds like lacking."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Well, well... That is a pickle..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Can't say I could find the words to help you, my child."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Where have you heard such claims?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I thought people from the western world were relatively open with\#their lust, premarital sex and whatnot."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I've heard such talk among certain followers of Alll-mer, but\#there are no such rules or writings in the old texts."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Such beliefs are usually born out of jealousy and desire to\#control."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I know this is not a pleasing topic for you to discuss, but I have\#one more question."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Have you acted upon this lust in any way?"
"I've pleased myself thinking of the person..."
"I've seen dreams of this person..."
"I've exchanged gazes with the person..."
"I've thought of the person while being with others..."
"I tried to take the person by force..."
"I haven't done anything."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Well I say!"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Hopefully it was a good one at least."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I would appreciate some details."
"We were together in the dream."
"It was a wet dream."
"I don't want to talk about it."
"It was an inappropriate dream."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Ah. Those dreams are a double-edged sword. On one hand you\#experience all the warmth this person has to offer..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"But ultimately you will have to wake up and realize that the\#cold reality awaits you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"There is no shame in letting our sub-consciousness free in a\#dream state."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"And the person has answered to your gazes?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is a fine line on what is appropriate and what is considered\#harrasment."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"But I will give you the benefit of the doubt."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I see, I see..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You should not worry about it too much in that case."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"No one can condemn us just because of the thoughts we have."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"We are moving on to a territory that could better be handled by\#the law enforcing individuals of this city."
"I thought you should react neutral?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That was never part of the deal. I can condemn you all I want."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"In this case I don't think even Alll-mer would look past your\#actions."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I hope to god, you didn't end up hurting this person physically.\#Mental damage is already done no question..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So it is only a thought so far..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"To be frank, I think you are beyond help."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"If the time comes and your one true god Alll-mer judges you at\#the gates of eternity..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is not a favourable situation for you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That is quite a broad topic."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"To whom were you dishonest?"
"To my partner..."
"To a friend of mine..."
"To my parent..."
"To a stranger..."
"I'd rather not say..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I see how that could be on you conscience."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is but a sign of good nature to feel remorse even for mere\#friends and acquaintances."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Depending on your relationship with them, this could be very\#drastic or nothing at all."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"I have to say it's is rather exceptional to feel remorse for\#a random stranger. But please do go on..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"How would you measure this dishonesty? Is it just a white lie,\#or a skeleton in your closet?"
"Just a white lie..."
"Medium lie..."
"A skeleton in a closet..."
"A cruel betrayal..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"That doesn't sound too bad."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Sometimes a little white lie can go to great lengths in protecting\#others from greater harm."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"It is all relative of course. A white lie can quickly grow in\#scale and become a serious issue in right, or wrong circumstances."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Small, medium... It is all relative of course."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Even a medium lie can quickly grow in scale and become a serious\#issue in right, or wrong circumstances."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Everyone has those, sometimes it is good to clean up the closet\#though."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oh my... Doesn't sound good."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Do you still keep this secret to yourself, or is it out in public?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Have you been caught lying, is what I'm trying to say?
"I haven't been caught yet..."
"I'll take it to the grave with me."
"It's out... I was caught in act."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Hm.. I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Oof. Well there you go..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"A lie ceases to be a lie once you are caught. It becomes an insult,\#a violation or betrayal at that point."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"So your sin ceases to be as well. At least it ceases to be in\#that form..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Personal insults and betryals... You answer about those only to\#the people involved."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"There is no use asking for forgiveness from the gods."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You are good in my books, 'my child'."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"The problem with dishonesty and lying is that you can never\#absolve it unless you come clean."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Dishonesty is a paradoxical sin. As the only one who truly suffers\#from it is you, eating away your stature and mind."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"After coming clean, it ceases to be a lie and instead takes a\#new form of an insult, violation or betrayal. And to ask forgiveness..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"Only the people in question can help you in that. Gods cannot\#offer forgiveness on behalf of the others."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\#"You are good in my books, 'my child.'"

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"The people of this city are just varying degrees of crazy, ay?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"There are the dangerous lunatics on the streets and then there\#are those people inside the museum... Whatever is going on with\#them..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Is the same going to happen to us?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Do you hear music coming from the museum?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Maybe we should try to interview the people inside?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"To try and piece up the events that lead up to this apocalypse?"

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I mean the tower is right over there... So we finally made it?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"What a hike from the train. Too many stairs to my liking..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"This is the city museum... The only one. So it works as the art\#museum, the history museum and as bunch of other museums as well."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"It really is a small town wonder."

You are at the same time both terrified and tempted to touch the\#intricate ornaments of the ancient stone slab door...
Touch it
You feel energy flowing to the door through your fingertips.
You feel euphoric.
Nothing happened.
"Echoing the words of the darkness, to vouch for the candour of their\#message:"

You are not sure if this feeling is that of enlightenment or that\#of total terror.
The gentle wind on your cheek feels alien. With this newly\#acquired understanding, even the most minor sensations have this\#altered nuance to them. The moonlight tainted your existence.

All of a sudden this tree looks very familiar to you!
You stashed some stolen goods here when you were a kid.
You completely forgot them here because the orphanage found out\#about your misbehaving and locked you up for several weeks as a\#punishment.
Shortly after that you were enlisted to the army so you never\#had a chance to recover your stash.
There's something hidden inside the fallen tree...
You find 15 \c[2]Shillings\c[0] and an old bottle of \c[2]Beer\c[0].
Why were they hidden here?

\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"I kind of... Shoplifted them from the small store at the old\#town..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"Oh! This tree! This was the spot!"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"This was the stash I talked about."

The head has been shot. There isn't enough soil to plant the seed.
GabText You hear a gunshot...

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"A pile of burnt corpses... That's grim..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Do you mind if I take quick photos?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"This religious district gives me the creeps."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"I used to visit this little shore all the time... There's something\#soothing about the dark horizon that opens up here."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"W-what... What has happened here?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"I can't even bear to look at the bodies..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"You can hear the waves hitting the shore from here..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"It would be nice to live this close to the water.\. In any other\#circumstance that is."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"The burnt bodies... They seem to have malformations and mutations on\#their faces and bodies."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"You don't suppose they burnt the first victims of this 'disease' in\#hopes of stopping its spreading?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"It's getting windier the further east we go..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I should've packed a proper jacket with me."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Imagine if you couldn't feel any pain associated with drowning, \.and\#your suffocation reflexes wouldn't kick in...\. It would be so peaceful\#to just sink to the bottom of this lake..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Watch up to the surface and see the waves play with the dimming\#daylight..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Uh,\. nevermind. That sounded worse than how I intended."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I hope I'm not too much trouble with this wheelchair and everything?\#You'd say if I became a burden, right?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"I haven't been to this shore since I was baptised in the water..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"Not that I'd remember that, but yeah..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Oh right! This is the official baptism beach!"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"It doesn't matter how much you get punched,\. what matters is how\#many punches you can take.\. And how hard you can punch back.\. And\#how many times you get back up to punch again."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Or something along those lines... That's what my coach used to say."

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"We are not in the normal world anymore I presume..."
GabText A cold wind blows in the dark empty before you.
There is a pit here...
Throw a rock in it
The bottom of the pit is shrouded in darkness, so you can't quite\#tell how deep the pit really is...
You pick up a small rock and throw it in.
Sounds like the pit is quite deep...
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Ah, you are finally here."
Per'kele greets you in a monotonous voice.
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\#\c[7]"This should be good."\c[0]
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Congratulations of the highest degree."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I bow to your talents. You are the last survivor of the fourteen."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You managed to excel where the others have failed. It truly is\#a remarkable feat. A herculean task even."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You\. - Are\. - The Champion of Termina\. - The festival to end all\#festivals."
"I did what I was asked to, now where is my reward?"
"I didn't do any of this for you or the festival..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Ah yes..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"No matter. I don't question nor even care about your motives."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"As promised, you are entitled to the grand prize/price."
You are not sure if Per'kele is talking about prize or price here.
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"A peek to grandeur and a chance to reach for the illustrious heights."
"What does that even mean?"
"I don't care. I'm here to kill you and the Moon God."
"I just want out. Out of here and out of this city."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I think explanations are finally in order."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Hooo? Is that so...?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Your bloodlust knows no end at this point?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"If that truly is your wish, then sure, go ahead..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I won't stand in your way. The Moon God is waiting there, looming\#high in the sky. \.Swing away with your sword!"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\.."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Well?"
"I can still take you down."
"How can I reach the Moon God?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"If that is your wish..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Impressive... Very impressive indeed..."
Per'kele is dead.
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"How can you reach any of the stars and planets sailing across the\#trails in the sky?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The void that opens up on top of our heads remains a mystery to\#this day."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Do not fret. There is no shame in backing down."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Wildly and blindly attacking anyone at this point would be a fruitless\#effort anyway."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"And miss the chance of your lifetime? Please at least hear me\#out first before making any hasty decisions."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You didn't massacre your way up here for nothing."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Let me explain..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The Moon God Rher is gone."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I apologize for such an unpoetic manner of speech, but..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"What you see in the sky is just a barren stone floating slowly\#in the space."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The Festival of Termina is Rher's doings, that much is true yes,\#but those powers are but faint traces left of his existence."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Rher, much like the other older gods left this world long time ago."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You might still be able to harness some of their powers, but like\#the festival, it is just a faint voice from the past that grants you\#those gifts."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Maybe that is evidence of their true strength, that even in their\#absence, and in some cases death, their powers still linger in this\#world."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"But without the consciousness behind these powers, their traces\#are nothing more than any other force of nature."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That force is not there to help you, to harm you or to be worshipped\#by you. It just exist."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That leads me to you..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Humans, the common people desperately putting their faith on these\#obsolete powers, they are ultimately alone in this world..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"There is no one looking after you if you were to return to that world.\#No one looking after you but plenty of forces ready to exploit you\#down to the bone."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The world where you came from, where you were driven where they\#want you and when they want you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You were just another pawn in the greater scheme of things. Just\#another fool lead by the so-called new gods, who are nothing more\#than dirty little sinners just like yourself..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The only difference being that they devoured their way to the top\#of the pyramid before anyone else had a chance."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"What do you call the starvation and poverty the world has faced?\#Horrible occurences in history that were inevitable bumps on the path\#of progress?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"What would you call the last two great wars where hundreds of\#thousands, no - millions perished?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"They are but part of the greater scheme. The sinners just pulling their\#strings from the grand hall they reside in to further establish their\#position."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That is vile if you ask me.\. I trust such power to no man. Do you?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Maybe what they say about absolute power really is the absolute truth."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Maybe order and peace truly are just a distant utopia."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That is why we have chosen chaos."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"What you have gone through since your destined arrival on that fated\#day,\. it would seem that you are no stranger to chaos..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"One could even argue you revel in it whenever possible. My master\#certainly is pleased of what he has seen."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"A peek to grandeur and a chance to reach for the illustrious heights...\#They are gifts only offered to select few. Those who possess the right\#traits..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"If you want to continue on this path of chaos, as The Champion of\#Termina,\. you are given the privilege to join us as equals."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"So...\. What do you say?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Join us or return to the world where you came from as nothing more\#than a side note in untold history?"
"I'll join you."
"You say the gods are gone, yet you talk about your master..."
"You haven't answered what it is that you do?"
"I've heard enough, it's time for you to die."
"I want no part in any of this."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Well isn't that glorious?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You have chosen well."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"However...\. One last tribulation lies before you..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"All the souls you sent to our master. Now boiling in the presence\#of his never-ending hatred..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"To finish your transformation I need to send you too to his sulfuric\#cage."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Do not fret, it is like the summer and the winter at the same\#time. Scorching sun burning your skin, while the long tendrils of\#the cold freeze you from inside out."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"When you rise back from those dark pits, only then will you be\#a true representative of the Cult of Sulfur."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"So as equals we face. I can't wait to tear you to shreds."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Do not die too soon or the ritual will go to waste."
Your wounds are starting to weigh on you...
The world starts fading before your eyes...
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"My master..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Some concepts are beyond words as they would do the reality no\#justice."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"It is shame that human vocalbulary is such limited form of expression."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"But at the back of your head you must know that my master has\#already visited you and maybe you have even seen glimpses of him...?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That is really all I can say. At least until you take the leap and\#decide to follow us on this path of chaos."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The Moon God... While gone, his traces remain strong. The Festival\#of Termina is a product of his intense jealousy."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"But like said before, an intense power without conciousness behind\#it is nothing but a raging force of nature, not that unlike a hurricane,\#an earthquake or a volcanic eruption."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Thus the festival itself lacks a greater purpose. We decided to give\#it one."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The effect it has on people creates an ample opportunity to grow\#our ranks and shed blood for our master."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"For hundreds of years we have followed wherever the Moon God\#took us and we reaped his harvest instead."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Living and breathing from the chaos that ensues."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Of course we strive for the illustrious heights mentioned many times\#over. But to get there, we must climb a mountain of slain sacrificial\#lambs."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Pity."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You would rather return back to live as an earthworm even after\#learning how to cocoon yourself and eventually soar the sky?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Humans never cease to amaze me. Settling into sub-mediocrity..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Have it your way."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You have earned your freedom in the eyes of my master, however...\.\#One last tribulation lies before you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You see..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I have followed your journey since the beginning and I've slowly\#come to the conclusion that I simply hate your existence. Absolutely\#detest your guts. I can't stand the sight of you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"This is strictly personal. Between you and me."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"As promised, you are entitled to the grand prize."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You have faced death head-on, the only thing missing is facing\#death of your self."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The empty man-made morals, that hollow weight stirring deep inside\#you... All carved out. You will finally know what it means to be\#truly free."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"My master, yes..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I know it sounds redundant. To trade the worship of one god to\#another. Trading snake oil for quack remedy."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"But my master... My master promises freedom. Freedom, like you\#never knew even existed."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I know you yearn that. I can see it in your eyes. You wouldn't be\#standing here otherwise."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Deep down you know that you can never feel fulfillment. There is\#always something gnawing at you at the back of your head."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You could have all the riches in the world, a harem of fifty lovers,\#admiration and respect... Yet that hollow echo would still eminate\#from within."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Answer me honestly..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Have you felt true joy since you were but a naive child?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"I do not mean a brief moment of happiness, but real joy. One that\#shines through even during your darkest hour."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You do not need to answer. I know the answer. Humans were born\#to suffer. They possess the eternal hunger that will never be\#satisfied."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"To fool themselves, they came up with rules and routine to help\#pass the time. An artificial sense of achievement. Self-defined\#attributes to determine who is good, bad, successful or a failure."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Living in a cage of their own making. If you live in a cage, you\#are never free."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You need to tear that prison down, brick by brick. You must strip\#yourself of man-made morals and ethics..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The rules and routine to pass the time. You must stop passing the\#time and jump straight to the end."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Death awaits at the end. Your only salvation. Witness death, deal\#death and finally experience death."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That is the only way."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You do not want to go back as an empty shell."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Congratulations. You are the last one standing..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Yes..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Is that so. I'm not sure I like your attitude..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"No matter."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"As promised, you would be entitled to the grand prize/price."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"That is what you'd like to know... Maybe you are worthy of the\#explanations..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"But what do you think happens next...?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"......"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"This is what you wanted right...?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Hear that...?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"He's... coming already..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Time for you to wake up."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You are not curious about the endgame in the slightest?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"So... what is the function of the festival if it lacks greater\#purpose?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"We decided to give it one."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The effect the moon has on people creates an ample opportunity\#to grow our ranks and shed blood for our master."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"You too had a chance to join our ranks... But bloodlust doesn't\#boil inside you quite the way we'd hoped."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"So that's it. No illustrious heights for you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"The only grand prize I can offer at this point is your freedom."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\#"Only I stand in your way."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"One second we were at the manor and now we're here."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"We are not in the mayor's manor anymore I presume..."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"What's the purpose of this junk?"

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"This doesn't feel real now does it?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"It's like someone set this up. Almost like a movie scene."

\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"What exactly is this room supposed to symbolize?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"It's a ... Police scene?"
There's nothing here.

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"The moment you send your troops over to another sovereign country,\#that's when this shit stops being self-defence!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Disgusting."

You find a \c[2]One-winged necklace\c[0].
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Try to walk only in open areas."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"We are happy of your expertise. Having 'covered wars' sure comes\#handy in situations like these."
There are a lot of chairs here.
The sink has mysterious stains in it.
The toilet is filthy and disgusting, but you suspected as much even\#before checking it out.
The stairs have been cut. Looks like someone did this intentionally.
The bed is full of gore. You don't feel like sleeping in it.
It's a television set. There doesn't appear to be electricity here,\#so you cannot use it.
The body is in a horrible condition. It's impossible to tell what\#has happened to this person.
The bucket has nothing interesting in it. Just random rubbish.
There are only underwear and old socks in the drawer.
A bloody tray.
The sink is dirty. No one in Prehevil seems to know much about\#hygiene and keeping things tidy...
Not a single soul returned from this trip...
\c[2]\v[1816]\c[0] managed to survive through all the horrors...
Only \c[2]1\c[0] managed to survive through all the horrors...
The only soul that returned from the trip was you...
After the events that transpired in your home town, there was no\#looking back anymore.
It was for the better. You were forced to cut all your ties to the\#past. It was liberating. You were finally free.
...Or that's how it felt for the first few weeks at least. Slowly\#everything you had witnessed started to weigh on you.
To push back all the misery and horrors, you drifted from one place\#to another. Never growing roots to any specific place. Always on the\#run so you wouldn't have to confront the past...
You'd arrive to a new city, in a new country, do whatever work you\#got for a while until the events of Prehevil started to invade your\#nightmares once again.
That's when you knew it was time to go once again.
Maybe one day you'd get far enough so the past couldn't follow you\#anymore? Or maybe the past would finally catch up to you?
You didn't have any burden left from your old life. It was a bitter\#sweet feeling. Your ties to your family and past were severed thanks\#to the traumatic events that transpired in Prehevil.
The thought of returning to Vatican City to continue your studies\#didn't sound appealing. Not after everything you had seen. Some\#things were not meant for humans to meddle with.
As years went on, you drifted all the way to the country of Valland\#and found yourself settling down at the red lights district of\#the capital.
You had trouble fitting in with regular people who were unaware of\#the greater scheme of things, but from the people that inhabited\#the red lights district you found kindred spirits.
Everyone carried baggage there and no one judged no one.
Occult skills helped you make friends easily and there were many\#ways you could make a living there with help of little magic.
Things were pretty nice actually. Now if you could only tell who\#this photobombing person was... She had been trying to make friends\#with you for the longest time... Pretty annoying.
Well that solved nothing. All this and you were still none the\#wiser.
Mystic deities, unknown gods, unholy rituals... Nuggets of\#information... Were the answers buried somewhere amongst all this\#madness?
Would the answers even matter anymore? If the baron von Dutch had\#dirtied his hands with blood, then you had reveled in bloodbath in\#comparison to get where you are now.
You hear the heavy footsteps of that wicked cat. He knows what\#you've done. In Prehevil and before. The cat is circling around\#you in the darkness. Just beyond your line of sight.
Maybe you should just take his offer? What else do you got going\#for you?
Nothing. That's right.
It's peculiar, isn't it old sport? The life that is.
You couldn't sleep after what you had witnessed in Prehevil.\#You knew too much about the universe and what horrors it hid in\#the darkness of the night.
The endless void above in the sky taunted you. It laughed at you.\#You had finally realized how miniscule humans truly were in the\#grand scheme of things.
Your insomnia almost drew you insane. But you had always been one\#to look for answers and solutions. Surely there was an answer to\#be found here too.
The moon had paid you a visit and gazed at you for a brief second.\#To ask for answers, you'd need pay the Moon God a visit too.
You took high positions in fields that studied space technology.\#Over the years, things started to advance and only after a decade\#you were already getting ready to launch people to the moon.
You'd get an audience with the moon soon. Not with ancient rituals\#or occult, but thanks to technology and human wit.
Whether it was a good idea remains to be seen...
The cult of sulfur... the followers of Rher... the church of\#Alll-mer... Were they any different from yellow mages?
They all served someone else ultimately. Your master just happened\#to be a foul mouthed old raisin whom the time had forgotten.
You threw your master to the nearest lake. Maybe some poor bastard\#would find him there centuries later and be led like a fool on a\#leash to do their master's bidding. But that was not your part\#any longer.
You returned to Abyssonia, to your homeland.
The reason you had initially left the whole continent was because\#of the state of religion and worship there. The teachings of\#Alll-mer had taken over the old beliefs.
You had gathered enough knowledge and skills on your travels to\#rival what the local temples promoted.
These lands would follow your teachings in the future. Teachings\#that would benefit the ones practitioning your way. Not the ones\#in power, nor the establishment.
One could almost be fooled into thinking this was an altruistic\#act. Of course in a true yellow mage manner, you'd be the one on\#top of the pyramid this time around.
Something good actually came from your traumatic experiences in\#Prehevil. It did take years of therapy to realize this, but slowly\#you understood what you were truly capable of.
You were the Champion of Termina. You. In your wheelchair and\#all. Somehow you were the sole survivor in what took place in\#that godforsaken backwaters town.
You also started to feel the spirit of your sister as years went\#on. She was accompanying you everywhere you went.
You never fully understood what happened to her, but she followed\#you every step of the way since you two left that wicked city.
You gained courage and confidence from that ordeal. With that newly\#found confidence you set out on the most remote locations in the\#world to study their flora and fauna.
You had learned that the nature took care of you no matter where\#you went. You didn't have limitations of human body anymore.
For the first time in your life, you felt true freedom.
The city of Prehevil was meant to be just a stepping stone on\#your path to greener pastures. Instead it turned out to be a place\#that shaped the very person you ended up becoming.
Your sister was waiting for you in the Kingdom of Rondon, that was\#the plan. She welcomed you unknowing of the horrors you had\#witnessed on your way there.
You never spoke of your experiences, even if those events ate you\#up every night as you laid down to sleep.
People walked the streets of Rondon every day without knowing what\#was lurking in the shadows of every dark corner of the world.
It was better that way. It was better that they didn't know how\#helpless they truly were against the cosmic horrors out there. But\#you could help them prepare if they ever had to come face to face\#with anything of that nature.
You started running a boxing gym with your expertise. The attendees\#would step inside in hopes of learning how to defend against common\#street thugs, but they would step outside ready to face the unknown.
Saving people's lives like this even alleviated some of your\#inner guilt. You had taken lives of many, but maybe you could\#finally give something back as well.
The events of Prehevil shook you to the core. Suddenly many things\#in life felt meaningless against this overwhelming realization of\#what hides behind the veil between the known and the unknown.
As you returned back to civilization, you understood that your\#experiences would sound like ramblings of a mad man if you ever\#tried to put them down on paper.
You needed proof before you could open your mouth. You had witnessed\#the rumours about the New Gods and Kaiser in real life. You knew\#they were real.
This was half the job already. Now you only needed to convince the\#rest of the world of this forbidden information.
This goal helped you get by each day. You needed clear goals to\#block the dread out of your mind.
You started digging. Like you had always done. Sooner or later you\#would get to the root of things. It remains to be seen whether your\#sanity will withstand the truth or not...

The bookshelf is scorched. Nothing remains here.
Nothing interesting here.
The table is scorched...
GabText Father Hugo is shot down.
GabText Father Hugo is shot down!
GabText As if mocking firearms, the priest embraces your shots with joy.
A broken Tes'tich table stands before you. It's no use to you like\#this...
A Tes'tich table stands before you...
Use hexen
Macabre sculptures hold a stone tablet with ritualistic symbols.\#The symbols look familiar... You feel like you've seen them in\#your dreams.
It's a misty night outside. The moon shines strangely bright,\#lighting up the entire window.
It's a misty day outside.

The grand priest has nothing left.
You find \c[2]Headmaster's key\c[0]!
You find \c[2]Headmaster's key\c[0] under the gore.
There is a scorched wooden chest here...
Whatever was inside this chest burned with the scorched earth...
The books here are simple school books. They are no use to you.
Miscellaneous school items lay in the box.
A couple of crumbled papers fill the bin.
The bin is scorched.
The statue observes the office with its glassy eyes.
The clock is stuck at 14:35.
A peaceful vista. There are some storm clouds gathering in the\#distance...
Portraits of school staff. Everyone shares one common feature -\#a thousand-yard stare.
You find a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0]!
The cable ends here. The drop doesn't look too bad. You could\#jump down, but there would be no way back up from here...
Go back
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"Do we have to do this here?"
There is no power to use the elevator, but there are ropes\#hanging in the shaft that could be used to climb down...
A rusty bucket. Sometimes a bucket is just a bucket and nothing else.
There is no power to use the elevator, but there are ropes\#hanging in the shaft that could be used to climb up...
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"What is this thing doing in the caverns in the first place?"
The shelf has various different diagrams and schematics piled on\#top of each other. None of them seem interesting to you at this\#very moment.
There are random documents laid down on the table.
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"Good afternoon..."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"It's Kida Tanaka. Good to make your acquaintance."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\#"THEN I SWALLOW YOU WHOLE!"
There's nothing interesting left here anymore.
You pick up the \c[2]God manifesto\c[0].
A skeleton monk stand forever in guard here...
The skeleton monk collapsed the moment you touched it...
Cobwebs decorate the pile of skulls...
You press through the crack...
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"A crypt? Charming."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"These tombs... What do they say...?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"These graves date back to the founding days of Prehevil. Wow,\#they're ancient!"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"For some reason I'm not one bit surprised to find myself in a\#cold dark crypt like this. This completes the Prehevil experience\#really."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Death seems to be the main theme really around this city, huh?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"I never know how to feel around graveyards, or well crypts like\#this."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"It's always so peaceful but something about the idea of walking\#around death gives me the creeps..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"The markings on these graves suggest a more primitive form of\#Alll-mer worship..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"The ritual crucifix at the old town already suggested as much,\#but it is interesting see more from that bygone era."
GabText A cold air fills the crypt...
The wall has been breached here...
Squeeze inside
It's dark inside. Looks like a crypt. You're not sure because of\#the darkness, but it almost looks like there are figures standing\#there...
It's dark inside.
It's dark inside. Looks like a crypt or something akin to that.\#It's hard to make out anything else...
Scribblings in blood. You do not recognize the language.
Looks like who ever lived here was in process of moving out when\#all this happened in the town...
There are erratic scriblings on the paper...
"No. It's still not the same.\#Something wrong with the carvings.\#I need to get all the details."
"Tes'tich table - Done\#The wall of enlightenment - In progress"
The stand has many empty scrolls gathering dust. Why hoard empty\#scrolls? That is a question you ponder.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Oh, this place...?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"This is the house of that creep. Father Hugo..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"They say he has lived for hundreds of years. Some say he's a\#vampire, some say he just bathes in the blood of newly born babies."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Vampires exist?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Sure do. And they sparkle in sunlight too."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Werewolves also exist. And mummies."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"You are just making fun of me now, aren't you?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Ha ha, maybe. But it's funny because it's true too."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Now I'm just confused."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"This house belongs to Donnovan Hugo... You don't say?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"He is a known occultist."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"A bit too eager with some his theories if you ask me, but regardless\#of that... He is a noteworthy figure when it comes to matters of\#otherwordly."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"There are cardboard boxes everywhere... Looks like someone was\#either moving in or moving out..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"I wonder if it's because of the events that transpired here?\#Someone who knew what was coming trying to leave before shit hit\#the fan?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"A bold colour choice. Deep blue is not for everyone..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"Painting your bedroom blue is a surefire way to kill passion."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"These things matter."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"This blue is giving me a headache..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"This apartment looks like it belonged to someone important.\. Or\#wealthy."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"I don't really know this part of the town all that well..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"They didn't want my kind loitering around..."
Marcoh is looking around in silence. He doesn't say anything, but\#is clearly curious about the apartment.
"Sacrificial circle - Done"
You're not even sure what you're looking at...
Detailed stone carvings fill the wall.
The carvings look fairly recent, despite mimicing an older style.
"I need to get my hands on another book of its kind. It's the\#only way. I can't create a perfect replica without travelling there\#again."
"Time is running out. I need the book."
"I need to leave. Soon. Before it's too late."
"Too late. I saw the dream."
There was a book buried here!
You find the \c[2]Skin bible - Vinushka (unedited)\c[0]!
"In my dreams I've seen the towers... The hollow husks of the\#endless city, those who patiently wait for their king to return..."
"The king?"
"It is not the domain of the new gods."
"The carvings depict people joint together under the sun."
"The book is the key. I've seen the macabre murals of the ancient\#city, I've lost myself in the endless maze of its lone alleyways."
"Return of the king."
"Return of the sun."
"The replica is near perfect."
"It is not the domain of humans."
"At least it didn't use to be."
"Under one sun, people finally join together in the promised land."
"'The sulfur sun' appears in the texts frequently. But I do not\#think that's the sun referred in the carvings."
"A sun that blazes from underground doesn't match with the passages."
"The sun..."
"The city haunts my waking hours.\#Relentlessly.\#Endlessly."
"After a long night, the dawn finally arrives, inviting us to\#the promised land."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\#"An army tent?\. Smells like Bremen pig to me."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"What's better than camping out in the wild?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"To feel the fresh morning dew the moment you wake up, to see\#flowers slowly open up and welcome the first rays of the sun..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"It's great."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"Boy do I hate camping."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\#"If you like it, that's all fine of course.\. We can be different."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\#"Ah..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"In normal circumstances I wouldn't mind staying here for a night\#or two..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\#"But these woods don't feel safe, do they? It's not just me right?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"I've done enough camping for one life time."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\#"Back when travelling with my parents, we often slept by the\#forest edges. My parents weren't really malleable to citylife and\#they rather took refuge in the nature."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"I didn't think I'd end up in another one of these..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\#"It's a military grade tent."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It is popular pastime among westerners to camp out, am I wrong\#in this statement?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\#"It's absurd. Only once you have the choice, would you consider\#it pastime to revert back to living in tents."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"I always associate tents with Vatican slums instead of camping\#in the wild."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\#"Funny."
